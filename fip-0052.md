# Abstract
This FIP implements a new standard for using contract addresses as token codes and modifies on-chain validation to extend the maximum length of token code from 10 to 128 characters and to allow these characters: `!@#%^&()_+=-;:,.<>/?`.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|addaddress|/add_pub_address|Modifies processing to allow `!@#%^&()_+=-;:,.<>/?` characters and max length of 128 characters in token_code.|
|fio.address|remaddress|/remove_pub_address|Modifies processing to allow `!@#%^&()_+=-;:,.<>/?` characters and max length of 128 characters in token_code.|

# Motivation
With a proliferation of meme coins on sites like pump.fun, it has become impractical to update the token code definitions in [FIP-15](fip-0015.md) to properly identify every new token being issued. With many of these new tokens, the industry often identifies them using a contract address. FIO Protocol can easily support this by standardizing the use of contract addresses as token codes. However, on-chain token code validator would have to be modified. [FIP-15](fip-0015.md) token codes and contract addresses could be used interchangeably.

# Specification
## Contract Address Standard
This FIP proposes the codification of contract addresses to be used inside token codes as follows:
```
chain_code: SOL
token_code: ca:9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump
```

Integrating wallets would look for "ca:" prefix and if found would use the contract address to identify the specific token on specific chain. Chain codes will not be affected. This will apply to both FIO Handle mappings as well as FIO Requests.

## Modified actions

#### Processing
* `!@#%^&()_+=-;:,.<>/?` characters and max length of 128 characters are now allowed.
#### Response body

# Implementation
Modify validateTokenNameFormat in [fio.contracts/contracts/fio.common/fio_common_validator.hpp](/fioprotocol/fio.contracts/blob/release/2.11.x/contracts/fio.common/fio_common_validator.hpp#L114) and [fio/libraries/chain/include/eosio/chain/fioio/fio_common_validator.hpp](/fioprotocol/fio/blob/d529643fc742cdb9b1a62a2e19f82be198461c90/libraries/chain/include/eosio/chain/fioio/fio_common_validator.hpp#L122) from:
```
    inline bool validateTokenNameFormat(const string &token) {
        if(token == "*") {
            return true;
        }

        return validateChainNameFormat(token);
    }
```
to
```
    inline bool validateTokenNameFormat(const string &token) {
        if (token.length() >= 1 && token.length() <= 128) {
            if (token.find_first_not_of("!@#$%^&*()_+=-;:,.<>/?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789") !=
                std::string::npos) {
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
```

## Release information
TBD

# Rationale
Extending validateTokenNameFormat is the easiest implementation to allow for contract addresses to be mapped to FIO Handles.

**Since FIO Request token_code is inside encrypted content field, there are no chain code changes required.**

SDK should also be updated as part of this FIP.

# Backwards Compatibility
No backwards compatibility issues. Wallets which have not adopted this FIP may receive a token_code string which does not correspond to any known value, but that should already be handled by wallets, since no wallet supports all tokens.

# Future considerations
None
