# Abstract
This FIP proposes a FIO Domain fee structure, which would increase the cost to register and renew domains shorter than 8 characters.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|regdomain|/register_fio_domain|Registers FIO Domain fee multiplier is implemented.|
|fio.address|renewdomain|/renew_fio_domain|Renew FIO Domain fee multiplier is implemented.|
|fio.address|regdomadd|/register_fio_domain_address|Registers FIO Domain and FIO Address fee multiplier is implemented.|

## Modified getters
|End point|Description|
|---|---|
|get_fee|Modified to include domain and returned multiplied fee.|

# Motivation
Currently all FIO Domains cost the same amount of FIO Tokens to register and renew. The fees are set by the Block Producers. However, an argument can be made that shorter domains are worth more than longer domains and therefore the on-chain cost should be higher. This would also discourage domain squatting.

# Specification
## Proposed fee structure
This FIP proposes a FIO Domain fee structure, which would vary the cost of registrations and renewals of FIO Domains by introducing a fee multiplier for domains shorter than 8 characters. The multiplier will apply to register_fio_domain, renew_fio_domain and register_fio_domain_address fees, if the corresponding domain is less than 8 characters.

|FIO Domain length|Fee multiplier|Example cost if fee $40|
|---|---|---|
|8+ characters|1x|$40|
|7 characters|2x|$80|
|6 characters|4x|$160|
|5 characters|6x|$240|
|4 characters|8x|$320|
|3 characters|10x|$400|
|2 characters|20x|$800|
|1 character|30x|$1,200|

### Example
* register_fio_domain fee is set by BPs at 1,000 FIO
* User attempts to register a 'test' domain
* The fee would be: 8 x 1,000 FIO = 8,000 FIO

## Modified actions
### Register FIO Domain
Registers FIO Domain fee multiplier is implemented.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: *regdomain*
#### End point: /register_fio_domain
#### New fee: The new fee structure as defined above is implemented
#### Request body
No change
#### Exception handling
No change
#### Response body
No change

### Renew FIO Domain
Renew FIO Domain fee multiplier is implemented.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: *renewdomain*
#### End point: /renew_fio_domain
#### New fee: The new fee structure as defined above is implemented
#### Request body
No change
#### Exception handling
No change
#### Response body
No change

### Register FIO Domain and Address
Registers FIO Domain and FIO Address fee multiplier is implemented.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: *regdomadd*
#### End point: /register_fio_domain_address
#### New fee: The new fee structure as defined above is implemented
#### Request body
No change
#### Exception handling
No change
#### Response body
No change

## Modified getters
### Get fee
Modified to include domain and returned multiplied fee.
#### End point: /get_fee
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|end_point|Yes|String|Name of API call end point, e.g. add_pub_address.|
|fio_address|No|FIO Address|FIO Address to consider for bundled transactions.|
|fio_domain|No|String|FIO Domain to register, if end point is register_fio_domain, renew_fio_domain or register_fio_domain_address|
##### Example
```
{
  "end_point": "add_pub_address",
  "fio_address": "purse@alice",
  "fio_domain": "bob"
}
```
#### Processing
* When fetching the fee for register_fio_domain, renew_fio_domain or register_fio_domain_address, the fee returned is multiplied by the corresponding multiplier for the supplied domain as defined above. If no domain is supplied, multiplier is not applied.
#### Exception handling
No change
#### Response
No change

# Rationale
A fee multiplier is an easy way to vary prices of FIO Domains without adding new fees.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
None. Existing action request and response bodies are unchanged. The new /get_fee parameter is optional and does not need to be supplied.

# Future considerations
None
