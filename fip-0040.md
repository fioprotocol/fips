# Abstract
The following FIP implements the ability to let domain owners allow specific accounts to register FIO Addresses on specific domains and pay corresponding registration fee.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.perms|addperm|/add_fio_permission|Add new FIO permission.|
|fio.perms|remperm|/remove_fio_permission|Remove FIO permission.|

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|regaddress|/register_fio_address|Allow FIO Addresses registrations on private FIO Domains, if domain permission was set.|
|fio.address|burnexpired|/burn_expired|Burn all the associated domain permissions when FIO Domain is burned.|
|fio.address|xferdomain|/transfer_fio_domain|Burn all the associated domain permissions when FIO Domain is transferred.|

## New getters
|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|/get_grantee_permissions|Returns all domain permissions for supplied grantee_account.|
|/get_grantor_permissions|Returns all domain permissions for supplied account.|
|/get_object_permissions|Returns all permissions for supplied object.|

# Motivation
FIO Chain allows only FIO Domain owner to register FIO Addresses on that domain and there is no way to create a custom permission which would allow another account to do it, assuming you:
* Want to allow registrations only on a specific domain and not all domains that account owns OR
* You want the registering account to pay the registration fee

This creates issues when the Foundation is offering to fund initial FIO Address registrations for an integration partner who wants to keep their FIO Domain private. There are several workarounds currently employed, but neither is solving the core problem. It is believed this enhancement would be desirable, not only for the Foundation, but also for any FIO Domain owners.

# Specification
## New actions
### Add permission
Add specific permission.
#### Contract: fio.perms
#### New action: *addperm*
#### New end point: /add_fio_permission
#### New fee: add_fio_permission, not bundle-eligible, fee amount will be 3 FIO
#### RAM increase: To be determined during implementation
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|grantee_account|Yes|FIO Chain account|Account that is granted and using the permission|
|permission_name|Yes|String|Custom name of permission. Currently supported: register_address_on_domain.|
|permission_info|Yes|String|Permission detailed info. This is an optional json string containing specific settings associated with a given permission. For register_address_on_domain this is not set since the existence of the granted permission means to "allow" address creation.|
|object_name|Yes|String|Name associated with object. Currently supported domain name owned by actor. Entering * is allowed and will permit registrations on all current and future domains owned by the signing account.|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-fee/get-fee) for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address of the entity which generates this transaction. TPID rewards will be paid to this address. Set to empty if not known.|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
##### Example
```
{
	"grantee_account": "deshputyz",
	"permission_name": "register_address_on_domain",
	"permission_info":"",
	"object_name": "alice",
	"max_fee": 0,
	"tpid": "rewards@wallet",
	"actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
* add_fio_permission fee is collected.
* RAM of signer is increased.
* Check for maximum FIO transaction size is applied.
* Permission is stored in state.

# Rationale
Two other approaches were considered:
* Create an action to specifically enable FIO Address registrations on private FIO Domain since that is the only need now. However, during design a more generic implementation made more sense as it did not introduce significant overhead and will create a frame.
* Current EOSIO permissions hack to allow the owner of a Domain to specify permission using updateauth and have regaddress action inspect that permission when someone is trying to register a domain. It was not selected due to its "hacky nature". Example:
  * Account A owns Domain D
  * Account A wants to let Account B register (and pay for) FIO Address on Domain D
  * Account A executes updateauth with
    * permission: readdress-DomainD
    * actor: AccountB
  * Account B executes regaddress on DomainD (using its own standard permissions) and regaddress checks standard EOSIO permissions to see if above entry is present for Domain D and allows the registration even though domain is private
