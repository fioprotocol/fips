# Abstract
The following FIP implements the ability to attach specific FIO Chain accounts to private domains in the form of domain permissions. This would allow those accounts to register FIO Addresses on those domains even though they remain private.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|adddomperm|/add_domain_permissions|Add permissions to FIO Domain to allow FIO Address registrations by specified accounts.|
|fio.address|remdomperm|/remove_domain_permissions|Remove permissions from FIO Domain.|
|fio.address|remalldper|/remove_all_domain_permissions|Removes all permissions from FIO Domain.|

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|regaddress|/register_fio_address|Allow FIO Addresses registrations on private FIO Domains, if domain permission was set.|
|fio.address|burnexpired|/burn_expired|Burn all the associated domain permissions when FIO Domain is burned.|
|fio.address|xferdomain|/transfer_fio_domain|Burn all the associated domain permissions when FIO Domain is transferred.|

## New getters
|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|/get_domain_permissions|Returns all domain permissions for supplied domain.|

# Motivation
FIO Chain allows only FIO Domain owner to register FIO Addresses on that domain and there is no way to create a custom permission which would allow another account to do it, assuming you:
* Want to allow registrations only on a specific domain and not all domains that account owns OR
* You want the registering account to pay the registration fee

This creates issues when the Foundation is offering to fund initial FIO Address registrations for an integration partner who wants to keep their FIO Domain private. There are several workarounds currently employed, but neither is solving the core problem. It is believed this enhancement would be desirable, not only for the Foundation, but also for any FIO Domain owners.

# Specification
## New actions
### Add domain permissions
Add permissions to FIO Domain to allow FIO Address registrations by specific accounts.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### New action: *adddomperm*
#### New end point: /add_domain_permissions

|permissions|account|Yes|12 character string|Account which is permitted to register on supplied domain.|
||max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-fee/get-fee) for correct value.|

## Modified actions
### Register Address
Allow FIO Addresses registrations on private FIO Domains, if domain permission was set.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: *regaddress*
#### End point: /register_fio_address 
#### Request
Unchanged
#### Processing
* If domain of FIO Address being registered is set to private and account registering has been set as permission for domain of FIO Address being registered or for * domain, the registration is allowed.
* Only the account registering the FIO Address is considered, authorizations of that account are not. For example:
  * Account permitted in permissions: 4qqa5xqtonku
  * Account registering FIO Address (actor parameter in regaddress): kjwqjksfxdmq
  * Account authorizations for kjwqjksfxdmq:
    * account: 4qqa5xqtonku
    * permission: active
  * Registration is not allowed

# Rationale
Two other approaches were considered:
* Create new FIO-specific permission scheme which would allow another account to execute FIO specific actions without customizing permissions on the call and while still acting as their own account and pay their own fees. However, since FIO Chain inherits a robust permission scheme from EOSIO, only FIO Address registration on private domain has been identified as a potential candidate for such functionality. Therefore building a more generic permission scheme seems overkill.
* Current EOSIO permissions hack to allow the owner of a Domain to specify permission using updateauth and have regaddress action inspect that permission when someone is trying to register a domain. It was not selected due to its "hacky nature". Example:
  * Account A owns Domain D
  * Account A wants to let Account B register (and pay for) FIO Address on Domain D
  * Account A executes updateauth with
    * permission: readdress-DomainD
    * actor: AccountB
  * Account B executes regaddress on DomainD (using its own standard permissions) and regaddress checks standard EOSIO permissions to see if above entry is present for Domain D and allows the registration even though domain is private

TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
No changes to requests/responses in existing actions or getters.
