## Abstract
This FIP implements a redesign of the fee voting and computation, and bundled transaction voting and computation in the FIO Protocol. Specifically:
* Fee computation will be removed from onblock and from [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) and attached to a dedicated action/endpoint.
* Top 150 block producers will be permitted to vote for fees and bundled transactions.
* A fee will be collected whenever a [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model), [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) is executed, and [bundlevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-bundled-transaction/submit-bundled-transaction-model)
* Only votes of top 21 block producers will be used to compute the fees and bundled transactions.

Proposed new actions:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|computefees|compute_fees|Computes fee votes and sets fees in the FIO Protocol.|

Modified actions:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|setfeevote|submit_fee_ratios|Can now be called by top 150 BP. Fee is added. Fee computation removed from this action.|
|setfeemult|submit_fee_multiplier|Can now be called by top 150 BP. Fee is added. Fee computation removed from this action.|
|bundlevote|submit_bundled_transaction|Can now be called by top 150 BP. Fee is added.|

## Motivation
The FIO Protocol was designed to enable top 21 producers to vote on protocol fees and bundled transactions via [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model), and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model).

The [computation of fees](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/fio-chain/bp#setting-fees) occurs after every [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) or [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model). The fees are also recomputed in the onblock every 126 blocks.

It has been found that the processing required to compute fees is too large to be handled in onblock or attached to action of setting fees, especially if number of block producers allowed to vote is increased beyond top 21, which has been discussed in [Issue 147](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/issues/147) and now part of this FIP.

To address this issue, a new endpoint dedicated to fee computation should be implemented. This will follow the same approach as other areas of the FIO Protocol, such as burning of expired addresses, and claiming of rewards.

## Specification
### New actions
#### Compute fees
Computes and sets fees in the FIO Protocol.
##### New end point: *compute_fees* 
##### Modify existing action in fio.system contract updatefees
##### RAM increase: none, this does not increase state
##### New fee: this action will not have a fee, as it will only process if work is needed and return exception otherwise
##### Request
Empty
##### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
  * Throw no work exception if no work is left to do.
* Compute the number of fees to process.
* Assemble the next NFP fees to process.
* Process the fees (set the votesPending false on update).
* Return response.
* Any account on the protocol can call this, but BPs should call as a service. Note it throws no work exception when its done all necessary work and so is protected from polluting the block log.
##### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|No work|No work to perform|400|"computefees"|"computefees"|"No work."|
##### Response
|Parameter|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|status|String|OK if successful|
|fees_processed|Int|Number of fees processed|
###### Example
```
{
	"status": "OK",
	"fees_processed": 7  
}
```

## Implementation
### Endpoint updates
none. using binary extensions ensures backwards compatibilty.
setfeemult, setfeevote -- are updated to set the dirty flag after checking that this is a TOP 150 BP.

#### Affected chain plugin endpoints reading fees
The following need to be migrated to the new table:
* chain_plugin

### Modifications to plugins
#### History plugin
none.

### Processing limits 
The number of fees processed per call must be adaptable as the number of producers registered increases and as the number of fees increases. Present testing shows that the protocol can process up to 20 fee votes per BP (when processing the top 21 only), so we go well under this to become an initial estimated processing limit of 10 fees to process per call.

We will limit the amount of work performed by each call to the compute fees endpoint, we will start at processing 10 fees each call. a no work exception will be thrown when all fees are processed.

The short explanation is that if there are more than 400 PFV to process, then 400 will be processed, until there are less than 400. "no work" exception will be returned when there are no records to process.

### Release information

The contract action computefees and the updates to setfeevote, setfeemult, and bundlevote were released in [fio.contracts v2.2.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.contracts/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

The compute_fees API endpoint released in [fio v3.0.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

## Backwards Compatibility
### Table migrations
We will add the new field to the fiofee struct as a binary extension, no table migrations will be necessary.
### Impact to existing calls
All entities using existing [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) actions will have to migrate to new actions, which now inlcude max_fee. However, since this call only impacts block producers, impact is minimized.

## Future considerations
None

## Development Branches.
### Repo -- FIO
Parent Branch -- Develop
Dev Branch name -- feature/Ed-FIP10-Develop-06122020

Description of contents --
This branch contains modifications to the FIO protocol core to add a new endpoint called compute_fees. 
These changes can be delivered after the contract changes at any time, since BPs can vote and update fees using push action and the actions in the fio.fee contract

Testing Considerations
Regression test the new endpoint.

### Repo -- FIO.contracts
Parent branch -- Develop
Dev Branch name --  feature/FIP-10-fiocontracts-develop-07132020

Description of contents --
This branch contains modifications to the set fee vote to permit 150 registered BPs to vote for fees. 
This branch introduces a new state table feevotes2 which will replace feevotes, feevotes is left in state for backwards compatibility and migrate-ability of offline tools.
This branch introduces votes pending flag to the fiofees table, this is a binary extension, replay testing is required!!
This branch modifies setfeevote, and update fees to use the new feevotes2 table.

Testing considerations
devnet testing is required due to teh requirement of having at least 15 of the top 21 BPs vote before median calculations willl occur
load up the system with 150 voting BPs
see that the system functions as expected when updatefees is called.
complete full regression testing on all fee voting, and all updatefees

This branch contains a new signing script to test compute fees.
This branch contains a new utility script to set fee votes.

### Repo -- fio.test
Parent Branch -- master
Dev Branch name -- feature/Ed-FIP10-master-06302020

Description of contents --
This branch contains changes to enable the testing of fee voting on dev net..
testing approach.
edit the fee voting fee setting javascript to add the desired number of registered and voting BPs (uncomment the individual create user tests to get the desired number)
run the test...this takes 5-10 minutes depending on the number of BPs set up.
after running the test, on your local dev box, with the chain running, perform the following commands.
unlock your wallet

Testing instructions (local dev box)
from the fio.test, run the javascript tests.
npm test 
wait until they complete (there will be a few errors during processing this is normal)
now in another window you can do these commands.
../fio/build/bin/clio -u http://52.247.194.34:8889 get table fio.fee fio.fee fiofees --limit 2000 | grep "\"votes_pending\": 1" | wc -l
this command shows the number of fees not yet processed by update fees.
../fio/build/bin/clio -u http://52.247.194.34:8889 push action fio.fee updatefees "{}" -p wttywsmdmfew@active
this command updates the fees.
run the two commands iteratively and see the 70 fees voted get processed into the system.
 ../fio/build/bin/clio -u http://52.247.194.34:8889 get table fio.fee fio.fee fiofees --limit 2000 
 this command will show the processed fees.
  
 Testing instructions (dev net) instructions.
 ssh -i "DapixWestPair2.pem" ubuntu@52.247.194.34
 cd devnet 
 ./stopall.sh
 cd ..
 cd fio.devtools
 ./start.sh   (select 2.0, 1,3,1) stop the present instance
 ./start.sh (select 2.0,1,1) restart devnet
 cd ..
 cd devnet
 ./goall.sh (this script starts up the a,b,c cluster, registers BPs, and votes them in)
 fiotop -u http://localhost:8889 (look and wait until all except c6 have produced block, for some reason c6 never does)
 once all have produced, you can run the tests from your local dev env.
