## Abstract
This FIP implements a redesign of the fee voting and fee computation in the FIO Protocol. Specifically:
* Fee computation will be removed from onblock and from [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) and attached to a dedicated action/endpoint.
* Top 42 block producers will be permitted to vote for fees.
* A fee will be collected whenever a [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) is executed.
* Only votes of top 21 block producers will be used to compute the fees. 

Proposed new actions:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|computefees|compute_fees|Computes fee votes and sets fees in the FIO Protocol.|

Modified actions:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|setfeevote|set_fee_vote|Can now be called by top 42 BP. Fee is added. Fee computation removed from this action.|
|setfeemult|set_fee_multiplier|Can now be called by top 42 BP. Fee is added. Fee computation removed from this action.|
|bundlevote|submit_bundled_transaction|Can now be called by top 42 BP. Fee is added.|

## Motivation
The FIO Protocol was designed to enable top 21 producers to vote on protocol fees via [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model).

The [computation of fees](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/fio-chain/bp#setting-fees) occurs after every [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) or [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model). The fees are also recomputed in the onblock every 126 blocks.

It has been found that the processing required to compute fees is too large to be handled in onblock or attached to action of setting fees, especially if number of block producers allowed to vote is increased beyond top 21, which has been discussed in [Issue 147](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/issues/147) and now part of this FIP.

To address this issue, a new endpoint dedicated to fee computation should be implemented. This will follow the same approach as other areas of the FIO Protocol, such as burning of expired addresses, and claiming of rewards.

## Specification
### New actions
#### Compute fees
Computes and sets fees in the FIO Protocol.
##### New end point: *compute_fees* 
##### Modify existing action in fio.system contract updatefees
##### RAM increase: none, this does not increase state
##### New fee: this action will not have a fee, as it will only process if work is needed and return exception otherwise
##### Request
Empty
##### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
  * Throw no work exception if no work is left to do.
* Compute the number of fees to process.
* Assemble the next NFP fees to process.
* Process the fees (set the votesPending false on update).
* Return response.
* Any account on the protocol can call this, but BPs should call as a service. Note it throws no work exception when its done all necessary work and so is protected from polluting the block log.
##### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|No work|No work to perform|400|"computefees"|"computefees"|"No work."|
##### Response
|Parameter|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|status|String|OK if successful|
|fees_processed|Int|Number of fees processed|
###### Example
```
{
	"status": "OK",
	"fees_processed": 7  
}
```

## Implementation
### Endpoint updates
none. using binary extensions ensures backwards compatibilty.
setfeemult, setfeevote -- are updated to set the dirty flag after checking that this is a TOP 42 BP.

#### Affected chain plugin endpoints reading fees
The following need to be migrated to the new table:
* chain_plugin

### Modifications to plugins
#### History plugin
none.

### Processing limits 
The number of fees processed per call must be adaptable as the number of producers registered increases and as the number of fees increases. Present testing shows that the protocol can process up to 20 fee votes per BP (when processing the top 21 only), so we go well under this to become an initial estimated processing limit of 10 fees to process per call.

We will limit the amount of work performed by each call to the compute fees endpoint, we will start at processing 10 fees each call. a no work exception will be thrown when all fees are processed.

The short explanation is that if there are more than 400 PFV to process, then 400 will be processed, until there are less than 400. "no work" exception will be returned when there are no records to process.

## Backwards Compatibility
### Table migrations
We will add the new field to the fiofee struct as a binary extension, no table migrations will be necessary.
### Impact to existing calls
All entities using existing [setfeevote](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-ratios/submit-fee-ratios-model) and [setfeemult](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/submit-fee-multiplier/submit-fee-multiplier-model) actions will have to migrate to new actions, which now inlcude max_fee. However, since this call only impacts block producers, impact is minimized.

## Future considerations
None
