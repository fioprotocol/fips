# Abstract
This FIP modifies onchain validation to allow $ (dollar sign) as token code and chain code.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|addaddress|/add_pub_address|Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.|
|fio.address|remaddress|/remove_pub_address|Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.|

## Modified getters
|Getter|Description|
|---|---|
|/get_pub_address|Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.|

# Motivation
It appears that $ is being used in token codes on some chains, e.g. Ethereum, Binance SmartChain. Therefore, it should be allowed on FIO Chain. Example Ethereum contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x297d33e17e61c2ddd812389c2105193f8348188a

# Specification
## Modified actions
### Map blockchain public address
Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: addaddress
#### Request body
No change
#### Processing
* $ (dollar sign) in token_code and and chain code are now allowed
#### Response body
No change

### Map blockchain public address
Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### Action: remaddress
#### Request body
No change
#### Processing
* $ (dollar sign) in token_code and and chain code are now allowed
#### Response body
No change

## Modified getters
### Get a public address mapped to FIO Address
Modifies processing to allow $ (dollar sign) in token_code and chain code.
#### Request body
No change
#### Processing
* $ (dollar sign) in token_code and and chain code are now allowed
#### Response body
No change

# Rationale
Allowing of $ is the easiest implementation.

SDK should also be updated as part of this FIP.

Due to obvious and non-controversial nature of this FIP it's proposed as Accepted.

# Backwards Compatibility
No backwards compatibility issues.

# Future considerations
None
