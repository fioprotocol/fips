# Abstract
This FIP updates /get_fee to properly return a token fee for actions which are bundle-eligible, but do not require a FIO Address.

## Modified getters
|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|/get_fee|Made FIO Address optional for actions which do not require a FIO Address.|

# Motivation
Currently the [/get_fee](https://dev.fio.net/reference/get_fee) endpoint requires FIO Address for any action which is [bundle-eligible](https://dev.fio.net/docs/on-chain-fees). However, not all actions require a FIO Address and may instead be paid with a token fee. This makes it impossible to check a token fee if your FIO Address has enough bundled transaction. It should be possible to check token fee on any action which does not require a FIO Address.

# Specification
## Modified getters
### get_fee
#### Request
Unchanged
#### Processing
Do not require FIO Address for the following fees:
* /stake_fio_tokens
* /unstake_fio_tokens
* /vote_producer
* /proxy_vote

#### Response
Unchanged

# Rationale
Change is required to properly communicate fees.

# Implementation
Consider how this list will be updated in the future when a new fee is added on an action which is bundle-eligible but does not require a FIO Address.

# Backwards Compatibility
No changes to requests/responses in existing actions or getters.

# Future considerations
None
