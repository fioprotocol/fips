# Abstract
This FIP modifies [FIP-6: Transfer locked tokens](fip-0006.md) in that:
* Tokens can now be locked in the same account without a need to transfer.
* Tokens can now be transferred locked into an existing account.
* Locks can be applied multiple times to the same account, as long as only one lock schedule is active at any give time.

Modified actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|trnsloctoks|transfer_locked_tokens|Removed restrictions requiring a brand new account.|

# Motivation
When [FIP-6 Transfer locked tokens](fip-0006.md) was initially introduced, the primary use case was transferring tokens to a new user and applying locks to transferred amount. Since then [FIP-21 FIO Staking](fip-0021.md) was introduced, which builds on Transfer locked tokens by adding an incetive to facilitate staking. This means users are more likely to lock their own tokens and requiring them to transfer tokens to another account creates friction and is not necessary.

# Specification
## Modifications to existing actions
### [trnsloctoks](fip-0020.md)
Removed restrictions requiring a brand new account.
#### Request
*payee_public_key* may now be:
* left blank - assumes lock should be applied to account of actor.
* public key which hashes down to actor - same as blank.
* public key which hashes down to any existing or new account.
#### Processing
Processing is modified to:
* Enable transfer to existing accounts or locking without transfer if applied to actor's account.
* Enable transfer/lock multiple times to the same account, provided that:
  * A new lock schedule can be added only if the old schedule has expired. For example is user locks 100 tokens for 1 year, they cannot lock more tokens until the year passes and all tokens are unlocked.
* Lock accounting should be recalculated after every transfer/lock to properly reflect a new consolidated unlock schedule.
#### Exception handling
Removed *Account already exist* error.
Add the following error(s):
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Lock already exist on this account|Account has an active lock.|400|"payee_public_key"|Value sent in|"Only one lock schedule can exist on account."|
#### Response
No changes

# Rationale
A new call was considered for locking tokens in same account as technically that is not a transfer, but was abandoned for simplicity sake.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
No impact on existing functionality.

# Future considerations
May be considered in the future:
* Allow user to trigger unlock with a "unstaking" period.
* Allow user to transfer tokens to another account without impacting locks, e.g. for security reasons when key is compromised.
