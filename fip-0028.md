# Abstract


## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|burnexpired|/burn_expired|Burn expired FIO Addresses 365 days (up from 90 days) after it has expired.|

# Motivation
There has been [an ongoing discussion regrading potentially eliminating FIO Address expiration](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FC/pages/106692690/Eliminate+FIO+Address+expiration+and+renewal+fees). In order to provide adequate time for that discussion to conclude and in order to address community's concerns regarding the potential security risk of an expired address being re-registered by an attacker, this FIP proposes extending the time from FIO Address expiration to burning from 90 days to 365 days. 

# Specification
