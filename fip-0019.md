# Abstract
This FIPs adds ability for wallets retrieve all received FIO Request.

New actions and end points:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
||get_received_fio_requests|Returns all FIO Request received irrespective of status.|

# Motivation
Currently the wallet can retrieve:
* Received FIO Requests in the Pending status using [get_pending_fio_requests](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-pending-fio-requests/get-pending-fio-requests)
* All sent FIO Requests using [get_sent_fio_requests](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-sent-fio-requests/get-sent-fio-requests)

There is no getter to fetch all received FIO Requests irrespective of status. Wallet could use [get_table_rows](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-table-rows/get-table-rows), but it requires hashing of values and potentially multi-table look-up.

# Specification
## New actions and end points
### Get received FIO Requests
Returns all FIO Request received irrespective of status.
#### New end point: /get_received_fio_requests
#### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_public_key|Yes|FIO public key|Valid FIO Public Key.|
|limit|No|Positive Int|Number of records to return. If omitted, all records will be returned. Due to table read timeout, a value of less than 1,000 is recommended.|
|offset|No|Positive Int|First record from list to return. If omitted, 0 is assumed.|
##### Example
```
{
  "fio_public_key": "FIO8PRe4WRZJj5mkem6qVGKyvNFgPsNnjNN6kPhh6EaCpzCVin5Jj",
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```
#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling
* All FIO Requests received by any FIO Address owned by account hashed down from the supplied fio_public_key is returned
#### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Invalid FIO Public Key|Format of FIO Public Key is not valid.|400|"fio_public_key"|Value sent in, i.e. "FIO8PRe4WRZJj5..."|"Invalid FIO Public Key format"|
|Invalid limit|limit is not valid|400|"limit"|Value sent in, e.g. "-1"|"Invalid limit"|
|invalid offset|offset not valid|400|"offset"|Value sent in, e.g. "-1"|"Invalid offset"|
|No received FIO Requests|There are no received FIO Requests for account.|404|||"No received FIO Requests"|
#### Response
|Group|Parameter|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
||requests|JSON Array|Array of FIO Requests|
|requests|fio_request_id|String|ID of FIO Request|
|requests|payer_fio_address|String|FIO Address of the payer. Request was sent from this FIO Address.|
|requests|payee_fio_address|String|FIO Address of the payee. Request was sent to this FIO Address.|
|requests|payer_fio_public_key|String|FIO Public Key of the payer. Account hashed down from this key owns the payer_fio_address.|
|requests|payee_fio_public_key|String|FIO Public Key of the payee. Account hashed down from this key owns the payee_fio_address.|
|requests|content|String|[Encrypted blob](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/wallet-integration-guide/encrypting-fio-data)|
|requests|status|String|Status of FIO Request.|
||more|Int|Number of results remaining|
##### Example
```
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "fio_request_id": "10",
      "payer_fio_address": "purse@alice",
      "payee_fio_address": "crypto@bob",
      "payer_fio_public_key": "FIO7167ErgCveJvuonvrEvVGhdWnkP4AEMfqvEd8s8raMkbbAXqhx",
      "payee_fio_public_key": "FIO7KGdMYj4ZMY2nUX9EaZu3G3GxZhTNXUq1tsNqC5rcP9rcmvWHq",
      "content": "...",
      "time_stamp": "2020-09-11T18:30:56"
      "status": "rejected"
    }
  ],
  "more": 0
}
```

# Rationale
The FIO Protocol functionality can be significantly improved for wallets without major compatibility disruptions.

# Implementation
define branching strategy for this change.
set up branch.
modify the chain plugin -- make a new get method get_received_fio_requests, use the get_pending_fio_requests as an example, modify inner logic so all results in the specified offset and limit are returned.
modify the chain_api_plugin to add the new chain RO call get_received_fio_requests.
modify chain_plugin.hpp add a new received_record, get_received_fio_requests_params and definitions of get_received_fio_requests.
rebuild, and dev test.
submit PR, review with the team.
estimated time to complete .5-2 working days.

### Release information
The get_received_fio_requests API endpoint released in [fio v3.0.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

# Backwards Compatibility
As this is a new getter method there is no backwards compatibility issues. Chain API code deploy will be required. After deployment, nodes which have not upgraded, will not support this getter method, but would otherwise function properly.

# Future considerations
None
