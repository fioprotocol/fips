# Abstract
This proposal addresses enhancements to the FIO Protocol command line utility known as CLIO:
* Create additional subcommands to support FIO actions
* Cleanup and repair of existing subcommands
* Handling of additional FIO error codes

# Motivation
The command line utility has not been maintained and deserves some customization for FIO before handing off to our community of block producers.

# Specification
## Added new subcommands
|Option|Subcommand|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Request|new|Create a new FIO Request|clio request new actor payer_fio_address payee_fio_address content tpid max_fee |
|Request|reject|Reject a FIO Request|clio request reject actor fio_request_id tpid max_fee|
|Request|cancel|Cancel a FIO Request|clio request cancel actor fio_request_id tpid max_fee|

|Address|register|Register a FIO Address|clio address register actor fio_address owner_fio_public_key tpid max_fee|
|Address|add_pub|Add a Public Blockchain Address to a FIO Address|clio address add_pub actor chain_code token_code public_address fio_address tpid max_fee|
|Address|remove_pub|Remove Public Blockchain Addresses from a FIO Address|clio address remove_pub actor chain_code token_code public_address fio_address tpid max_fee|
|Address|renew|Renew a FIO Address|clio address renew actor fio_address tpid max_fee|
|Address|remove_all_pub|Remove all Public Blockchain Addresses from a FIO Address|clio address remove_all_pub actor fio_address tpid max_fee|
|Address|transfer|Transfer a FIO Address to a new owner|clio address transfer actor fio_address new_owner_fio_public_key tpid max_fee|
|Fee|set_amount|Set endpoint fees (for producers)|clio fee set_amount fio_address actor max_fee end_point suf_amount|
|Fee|set_multiplier|Set the fee multiplier|clio fee set_multiplier double actor |
|System|claimrewards|Claim Block Producer Rewards|clio system claimrewards actor fio_address|
|System|tpidclaim|Pay our rewards to TPIDs|clio system tpidclaim actor|
|Convert|fiokey_to_account||clio convert fiokey_to_account fio_public_key|
|Transfer||Transfer FIO coins to a FIO public key|clio transfer fio_public_key suf_amount max_fee actor tpid|

## Removed subcommands
|Option|Subcommand|
|---|---|
|system|buyram|
|system|sellram|
|currency|retire|
|currency|transfer|

## Added functionality
|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Rename keosd|keosd folder, binaries and symbols renamed fio-wallet to avoid confict with keosd used on systems with a shared EOS installation|
|Default max_fee|max_fee is set to 800000000001 so user does not have to define manually. Any required fee set by the producers under this value will process|
|Custom Push Endpoints|Certain transactions are pushed to a FIO chain api push endpoint depending on the action. Any undefined go to /v1/chain/push_transaction|
|auto max_fee|v1/chain/get_fee is queried with the corresponding endpoint for the packed action and max_fee variable is set to this result|
|custom endpoint option|true/false bool that will allow all transactions to be pushed to custom endpoints or all to /v1/chain/push_transaction|

## Rationale
The current implementation of clio provides very basic functionality that allows signing and pushing of FIO transactions requiring nested json syntax which may be too difficult for some users.

## Implementation
Involves adding new objects, methods to clio main.cpp and httpc.hpp for some new strings.

## Future considerations
None
