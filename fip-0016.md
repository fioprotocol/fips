# Abstract
This proposal addresses enhancements to the FIO Protocol command line utility known as CLIO:
* Create additional subcommands to support FIO actions
* Cleanup and repair of existing subcommands
* Handling of additional FIO error codes

# Motivation
The command line utility has not been maintained and deserves some customization for FIO before handing off to our community of block producers.

# Specification
## Added new subcommands
|Option|Subcommand|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Request|new|Create a new FIO Request|clio request new payer_fio_address payee_fio_address actor content tpid max_fee|
|Request|reject|Reject a FIO Request|clio request reject fio_request_id actor tpid max_fee|
|Request|cancel|Cancel a FIO Request|clio request cancel fio_request_id actor tpid max_fee|
|Data|record|Record an on-blockchain transaction|clio data record fio_request_id payer_fio_address payee_fio_address actor content tpid max_fee|
|Domain|burn_expired|Process expired domains|clio domain burn_expired actor| 
|Domain|register|Register a new FIO Domain|clio domain register fio_address actor owner_fio_public_key tpid max_fee|
|Domain|renew|Renew a FIO Domain|clio domain renew fio_address actor tpid max_fee|
|Domain|set_public|Set a FIO Domain to Public or Private|clio domain set_public domain actor true tpid max_fee |
|Domain|transfer|Transfer a FIO Domain to a new owner|clio domain transfer fio_address actor new_owner_fio_public_key tpid max_fee|
|Address|register|Register a FIO Address|clio address register fio_address actor owner_fio_public_key tpid max_fee|
|Address|renew|Renew a FIO Address|clio address renew fio_address actor tpid max_fee|
|System|claimrewards|Claim Block Producer Rewards|clio system claimrewards actor fio_address|
|System|tpidclaim|Pay our rewards to TPIDs|clio system tpidclaim actor|
|Convert|fiokey_to_account||clio convert fiokey_to_account fio_public_key|
|Transfer||Transfer FIO coins to a FIO public key|clio transfer fio_public_key suf_amount actor tpid max_fee|

## Removed subcommands
|Option|Subcommand|
|---|---|
|system|buyram|
|system|sellram|
|currency|retire|
|currency|transfer|

## Added functionality
|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Rename keosd|keosd folder, binaries and symbols renamed fio-wallet to avoid confict with keosd used on systems with a shared EOS installation|
|Default max_fee|max_fee is set to 800000000001 so user does not have to define manually. Any required fee set by the producers under this value will process|

## Not yet implemented
|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|auto max_fee|v1/chain/get_fee is queried with the corresponding endpoint for the packed action and max_fee variable is set to this result|
|custom endpoint option|true/false bool that will allow all transactions to be pushed to custom endpoints or all to /v1/chain/push_transaction|

# Rationale
The current implementation of clio provides very basic functionality that allows signing and pushing of FIO transactions requiring nested json syntax which may become tedious and complex in some environments.

# Implementation
Involves adding new objects, methods to clio main.cpp and httpc.hpp for some new strings. [See Github](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/tree/feature/fio%2354_clio_enhancements/programs/clio)

### Release information

Released in [fio v3.0.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

# Future considerations
This FIP is intended to deliver general direction to those who wish to update the fio command line utility. As new features and actions are introduced into the FIO Protocol, it is recommended to update clio to allow general and easy subcommands to demonstrate their use.
