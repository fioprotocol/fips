# Abstract
This FIP modifies onchain validation to allow multiple FIO Public Keys to be specified in _updateauth_.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|eosio|updateauth||Modifies onchain validation to allow multiple FIO Public Keys in _keys_ parameter.|

# Motivation
Currently, when setting custom permissions, only one FIO Public Key can be supplied. This restriction was put in place to avoid the confusion associated with the automatic account creation and the importance of FIO Public Key for sending and receiving tokens. In fact, it was envisioned that only a FIO Public key which hashes down to the account name can be entered, although that restriction was not implemented, due to time-to-market priority.

Since Mainnet launch this functionality has been requested by integrators. In addition, it has since been determined that the potential benefit of this capability outweighs the potential risk of confusion. This FIP would allow for any number of FIO Public Keys to be supplied in custom permissions.
