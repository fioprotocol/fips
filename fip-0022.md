# Abstract
This FIP proposes enabling of the retire action, which will allow the caller to burn their own tokens.

Modified actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|retire||Added actor, validation and allow any account to call.|

# Motivation
The primary motivation is to support [FIP-21](fip-0021.md), which introduces Staking Reward Pool, but also requires that Foundation tokens get burned to keep total token supply at 1B. It may be used in the future by the Foundation or any other token holder wanting to burn tokens.

This action exists already, but is restricted to eosio account.

# Specification
## Modifications to existing actions
### retire
Added actor, validation and allow any account to call.

##### Example

#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
* Account balance is decremented by *quantity*.
* Total FIO token supply is decremented by *quantity*.
