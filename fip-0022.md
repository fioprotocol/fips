# Abstract
This FIP proposes enabling of the retire action, which will allow the caller to burn their own tokens.

Modified actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|retire||Added actor, validation and allow any account to call.|

# Motivation
The primary motivation is to support [FIP-21](fip-0021.md), which introduces Staking Reward Pool, but also requires that Foundation tokens get burned to keep total token supply at 1B. It may be used in the future by the Foundation or any other token holder wanting to burn tokens.

This action exists already, but is restricted to eosio account.

# Specification
## Modifications to existing actions
### retire
Added actor, validation and allow any account to call.
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|quantity|Yes|Int|Amount of SUFs to retire.|
|memo|Yes|String|Memo text (<256 bytes).|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
##### Example
```
{
  "quantity": 1000000000000,
  "memo": "burn baby burn",
  "actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
* Account balance is decremented by *quantity*.
* Total FIO token supply is decremented by *quantity*.
* Retiring of locked tokens is allowed for both Mainnet locks and FIP-6 locks.
  * Lock tables are adjusted for calling account (if exist).
    * If account contains both locked and unlocked tokens, locked tokens are retired first, than unlocked tokens.
#### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Invalid quantity|quantity is less than 1000000000000|400|"quantity"|Value sent in, i.e. "1000"|"Minimum 1000 FIO has to be retired"|
|Invalid memo|memo is >256 bytes|400|"memo"|Value sent in, i.e. "1000"|"memo has more than 256 bytes"|
|Insufficient balance|Balance is less than quantity|400|"quantity"|Value sent in, e.g. "100000000000"|"Insufficient balance"|
|Signer not actor|Signer not actor|403|||Type: invalid_signature|
#### Response body
|Parameter|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|status|String|OK if successful|
##### Example
```
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

# Rationale
Use of existing action is deemed to be the best approach.

# Implementation

Impacted source:

* fio.contracts/fio.token/fio.token.cpp
* fio/programs/clio/main.cpp
* fio/plugins/chain_plugin/chain_plugin.hpp
* fio/plugins/chain_plugin/chain_plugin.cpp
* fio/plugins/chain_api_plugin/chain_api_plugin.cpp

Details:

* Retire action of fio.token contract is modified 
* Authorization is changed from tokenissuer msig account to actor (parameter)
* New fio assertions added to support exception handling
* Send_response added
* Max_transaction_size limit added
* Retire action searches the accountstake table of fio.staking contract. Transaction is rejected if actor (parameter) is present in the table. 
* Search system lockedTokensTable for mainnet locks, lockTokensTable for general locks and reduce their count if present. Any rollover amount are subsequently reduced in the following order: account locks, general locks, token account balance (unlocked)
* If remaining lock amount for general or mainnet locks meet 0, the locks are removed 
* If a general lock amount is reduced, this does not impact the existing periods. The percentages impact the actual remaining lock balance
* Token account balance that is burned is also removed from the stats table (supply)

Updates to development environment:

* fio.devtools/scripts/actions/update_contracts.sh
* fio.devtools/scripts/launch/04_create_accounts.sh
* fio.devtools/scripts/launch/09_set_permissions.sh
* fio.devtools/scripts/launch/19_bind_dev_contracts.sh

# Backwards Compatibility
No impact as this action has not been used.

# Future considerations
Possible implementation to allow burning of tokens that are staked can be considered. This is currently not supported in the scope of this proposal.
