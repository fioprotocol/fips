# Abstract
This FIP proposes **FIO Staking**, an on-chain program which rewards users for participating in blockchain governance.

Fee distribution modifications:
|Recipient|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Block Producers|85%|60%|
|Staking Rewards|0%|25%|

Token supply modifications:
|Token group|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Staking Rewards Reserves|0|25,000,000|
|FIO Address Giveaways|125,000,000|100,000,000|

**Total token supply increase/(decrease): 0**

# Motivation
The FIO Protocol is subject to the network effect, meaning the more participants adopt it, the more useful it is to all. To accelerate the adoption, on-chain incentives for integrators in the form of TPID rewards and New User Bounties, as well as for block producers in the form of rewards and reserves are built into the FIO Chain. Currently, there are no incentives for end-users. Yet early token holders add value to the network by voting for block producers and helping the network grow.

This FIP proposes an on-chain staking functionality, which rewards users for taking an active role in the FIO Protocol governance.

# Specification
## Key concepts
|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|*Staking Reward Token* (SRT)|Representation of staking rewards. It is attached to an individual account when tokens are staked and also tracked as *Global SRTs*, which represent all SRTs issued.|
|*Rate of Exchange* (ROE)|Used to determine number of SRTs to issue based on staking amount, or additional FIO Tokens to issue when unstaking.|
|*Tokens Staked*|Staked FIo Tokens in account.|
|*Minimum Tokens Staked*|To avoid ROE volatility, staking should only be allowed, if *Tokens Staked* counter is greater than 1M FIO Tokens.|
|*Staked Token Pool*|Sum of all FIO Tokens staked plus *Staking Rewards*.|
|*Staking Rewards*|Tokens in treasury earmarked for staking rewards. Comes from 25% of fees collected plus *Staking Rewards Reserves*.|
|*Staking Rewards Reserves Maximum*|Set to 25,000,000 FIO tokens, it's the maximum number of tokens that can be issued to supplement *Staking Rewards* from fees.|
|*Staking Rewards Reserves Minted*|Amount of Staking Rewards Reserves minted to date.|

## High-level
### Staking
User can stake any available FIO Token amount in their account at any point in time. To stake, the account has to have voted or proxied tokens within the preceding 30 days. The FIO Tokens do not actually leave the user's account, but are instead "locked" and cannot be spent until unstaked.

When tokens are staked, they cannot be transferred, used to pay a FIO Chain fee, or [locked](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md).

*Tokens Staked* do count towards voting power of account.

Tokens locked via Mainnet or [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) locks, cannot be staked.

### Staking Reward Token
When user stakes FIO Tokens they "exchange" FIO Tokens for *Staking Reward Tokens* (SRTs) at then current *Rate of Exchange* (ROE). SRT is not an actual token and cannot be transferred. It simply acts as a representation of future staking rewards and is attached to the account which is staking.

### Staking Rewards
Currently when a fee is paid, it gets distributed as follows:
|Share|Recipient|
|---|---|
|85%|Block Producers|
|10%|Entity facilitating transaction (TPID) or, if not provided, block producers.|
|5%|Foundation|

This FIP proposes a change to the fee distribution to redirect 25% of the fee paid to the *Staking Rewards*, which will be used to reward users who are staking their FIO Tokens.

After this FIP is adopted, when a fee is paid, it is distributed as follows:
|Share|Recipient|
|---|---|
|60%|Block Producers.|
|25%|*Staking Rewards*.|
|10%|Entity facilitating transaction (TPID) or, if not provided, block producers.|
|5%|Foundation.|

#### Staking Rewards Reserves
In addition, if 25% of fees collected in any one day is less than 25,000 FIO, new tokens will be minted to increase the amount "reserved" for *Staking Rewards* to 25,000 FIO. The *Staking Rewards Reserves Maximum* will be set at 25M. Once that is reached there will not be a minimum daily amount redirected to *Staking Rewards*.

The Foundation will burn 25M FIO Tokens from Address Giveaway bucket to ensure total supply stays at 1B.

### Unstaking
User can unstake any amount in their account at any point in time. When they do, they will exchange SRTs back into FIO Tokens at then current *Rate of Exchange*. Since the ROE is likely to be higher at time of unstake, they will end up with more FIO Tokens than originally staked.

Since the user specifies FIO Tokens when unstaking, to determine the amount of SRTs that need to be converted, the following calculation is completed:
```
SRTs to Unstake = SRTs in Account * (Unstaked Tokens/Total Tokens Staked in Account)
```

The unstaked amount of FIO Tokens is locked in the account for a period of 7 days (using [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) logic) before it can be transferred or staked again.

### Rate of Exchange
ROE is determined based on the following formula:
```
ROE = Tokens in Staked Token Pool / Global SRTs
```
Tokens in *Staked Token Pool* is:
* incremented:
  * When users stake tokens
  * When tokens are earmarked as *Staking Rewards*
* decremented:
  * When users unstake tokens
  
Global SRTs is is:
* incremented:
  * When users stake tokens
* decremented:
  * When users unstake tokens
  
Because staking and un-staking increments/decrements tokens in *Staked Token Pool* and *Global SRTs* at the then current ROE, only addition of *Staking Rewards* to *Staked Token Pool* will increase the ROE.

In addition:
* ROE can only go up, so user is guaranteed at least their principal back.
* The sooner they stake the better the ROE.
* The more fees collected, the higher the ROE.
* Future ROE and therefore annualized return cannot be determined at the time of staking as it is dependent on future fees collected and tokens staked

### Rewards for TPID
When user unstakes FIO Tokens, the TPID attached to the unstake action receives 10% of the difference between tokens being unstaked and FIO Tokens received as a result of SRT to FIO Token conversion. If no TPID is provided, the 10% remains undistributed.

## Modified actions
### Fee collection on any action
Anytime a fee is paid, 25% of the amount collected is added to *Daily Staking Rewards* counter, but the entire amount of the fee is transferred to treasury account (same as today).

### BP claim
Modified to mint Staking Reward Reserves.
#### Contract: fio.treasury
#### Modified action: bpclaim
#### Modified end point: /claim_bp_rewards
#### Request body
No changes
##### Example
No changes
#### Processing
When bpclaim is ran for the first time in a 24-hour period and payment schedule is being built the following *Staking Rewards* logic will be executed:
* If *Daily Staking Rewards* is less than 25,000 FIO Tokens and *Staking Rewards Reserves Minted* is less than *Staking Rewards Reserves Maximum*:
  * The difference between 25,000 FIO Tokens and *Daily Staking Rewards* (or difference between *Staking Rewards Reserves Minted* and *Staking Rewards Reserves Maximum*, whichever is smaller) is minted, transferred to treasury account and added to *Staking Rewards Reserves Minted*.
  * *Daily Staking Rewards* is incremented by the tokens minted.
* *Daily Staking Rewards* amount is:
  * Added to *Total Staking Rewards*
  * Added to *Staked Token Pool*, which modifies ROE
  * Set to 0

# Rationale
## Other approaches
There were several versions of staking [discussed and considered](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/34078744/FIO+Staking). The SRT approach was modeled after [EOSIO REX Implementation](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.contracts/issues/117). EOSIO requires a transfer of tokens and issues a transferable REX token. FIO’s implementation does not have to require a transfer because:
* We do not have a requirement for the reward token to be transferable.
* We do have ability to lock tokens in account.

## Vote/proxy on unstake
Requiring users to vote/proxy within 30 days on ustake was considered, but abandoned due to potential usability impact.

## Burning/minting of tokens for Staking Rewards
An approach was considered to burn the 25% of tokens paid on any fee and then minting that amount when required to pay out the rewards on unstaking. It was abandoned to stay consistent with how fees are collected and tracked today.

# Implementation
## Token burning
Foundation will burn 25,000,000 FIO Tokens from [FIO Address Giveaways](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#tokens-minted-over-time) using retire action being implemented in [FIP-22](fip-0022.md). Bucket designation is pending.

## Variables to track in state
* *Rate of Exchange* (ROE)
* *Staked Token Pool*
* *Staking Rewards*
* *Staking Rewards Reserves Minted*
* *Global SRT*
* *SRTs* per account
* *Tokens Staked* per account
* *Daily Staking Rewards*
* *Total Staking Rewards*
