# Abstract
This FIP proposes **FIO Staking**, an on-chain program which rewards users for participating in blockchain governance.

## Fee distribution modifications
|Recipient|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Block Producers|85%|60%|
|Staking Rewards|0%|25%|

## Token supply modifications
|Token group|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Staking Rewards Reserves|0|25,000,000|
|FIO Address Giveaways|125,000,000|100,000,000|

**Total token supply increase/(decrease): 0**

## New Contracts
A new system account will be added to the FIO protocol. This will be called fio.staking. This new account will have a new contract of the same name. This contract will contain the global state and account wise information required for staking. The contract will also contain the required actions to modify this state information. The goal of this new contract is to reduce the contract bloat that might result if we were to add this information directly to the fio.system contract.  

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.staking|stakefio|stake_fio_tokens|Stake FIO Tokens.|
|fio.staking|unstakefio|unstake_fio_tokens|Unstake FIO Tokens.|

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Multiple|Fee collection on any action|Multiple|Modified to redirect 25% of fee paid to Staking Rewards.|
|fio.treasury|bpclaim|claim_bp_rewards|Modified to mint Staking Reward Reserves.|

## Modified getters
|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|get_fio_balance|Modified to consider and include staked tokens.|
|get_locks|Modified to return SUFs for periods instead of percentages.|

# Motivation
The FIO Protocol is subject to the network effect, meaning the more participants adopt it, the more useful it is to all. To accelerate the adoption, on-chain incentives for integrators in the form of TPID rewards and New User Bounties, as well as for block producers in the form of rewards and reserves are built into the FIO Chain. Currently, there are no incentives for end-users. Yet early token holders add value to the network by voting for block producers and helping the network grow.

This FIP proposes an on-chain staking functionality, which rewards users for taking an active role in the FIO Protocol governance.

## High-level
### Staking
User can stake any available FIO Token amount in their account at any point in time. To stake, the account has to be voting for at least 1 BP or proxying/auto-proxying. The FIO Tokens do not actually leave the user's account, but are instead "locked" and cannot be spent until unstaked.

When tokens are staked, they cannot be transferred, used to pay a FIO Chain fee, or [locked](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md).

*Tokens Staked* do count towards voting power of account.

Tokens locked via Mainnet or [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) locks, cannot be staked. If the account has Mainnet locked tokens, then the user may stake and unstake the unlocked portion of those tokens in that account (all unlocked tokens are eligible for staking, and should stake and unstake as expected). If the account has general [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) locked tokens, then the user may stake and unstake the unlocked portion of those tokens in the account (all unlocked tokens are eligible for staking, and should stake and unstake as expected).

The Account Staking Reward Point, and the Account Tokens Staked are updated when staking occurs. This maintains accurate staking information per account.

### Staking Reward Point
When user stakes FIO Tokens they "exchange" FIO Tokens for *Staking Reward Points* (SRPs) at then current *Rate of Exchange* (ROE). SRP is not an actual token and cannot be transferred. It simply acts as a representation of future staking rewards and is attached to the account which is staking.

### Staking Rewards
Currently when a fee is paid, it gets distributed as follows:
|Share|Recipient|
|---|---|
|85%|Block Producers|
|10%|Entity facilitating transaction (TPID) or, if not provided, block producers.|
|5%|Foundation|

This FIP proposes a change to the fee distribution to redirect 25% of the fee paid to the *Staking Rewards*, which will be used to reward users who are staking their FIO Tokens.

After this FIP is adopted, when a fee is paid, it is distributed as follows:
|Share|Recipient|
|---|---|
|60%|Block Producers.|
|25%|*Staking Rewards*.|
|10%|Entity facilitating transaction (TPID) or, if not provided, block producers.|
|5%|Foundation.|

#### Staking Rewards Reserves
In addition, if 25% of fees collected in any one day is less than 25,000 FIO, new tokens will be minted to increase the amount "reserved" for *Staking Rewards* to 25,000 FIO. The *Staking Rewards Reserves Maximum* will be set at 25M. Once that is reached there will not be a minimum daily amount redirected to *Staking Rewards*.

The Foundation will burn 25M FIO Tokens from Address Giveaway bucket to ensure total supply stays at 1B.

#### Combined Token Pool Minimum
Staking Rewards will only accrue if *Combined Token Pool* is equal to or greater than *Combined Token Pool Minimum*, which will be set to 1M. This is to prevent big swings in ROE when Staking Rewards are deposited when *Combined Token Pool* is low.

### Unstaking
User can unstake any amount in their account at any point in time. When they do, they will exchange SRPs back into FIO Tokens at the current *Rate of Exchange*. Since the ROE is likely to be higher at time of unstake, they will end up with more FIO Tokens than originally staked.

Since the user specifies FIO Tokens when unstaking, to determine the amount of SRPs that need to be converted, the following calculation is completed:
```
SRPs to Unstake = SRPs in Account * (Unstaked Tokens/Total Tokens Staked in Account)
```

The unstaked amount of FIO Tokens is locked in the account for a period of 7 days (using [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) logic) before it can be transferred or staked again. All tokens locked as a result of staking should unlock on the same time of day (0:00:01 GMT) to avoid multiple entries into lock table. This way the lock will be anywhere from 6 to 7 days depending on when the unstake action is called.

When unstaking, the protocol will remove any general locking periods that have already expired. This will provide users the ability to wait for periods to pass should they run into the situation where they have close to the maximum permitted locking periods in thier general locks.

The *Account Staking Reward Point*, and the *Account Tokens Staked* are updated when unstaking occurs. This maintains accurate staking information per account.

### Rate of Exchange
ROE is determined based on the following formula:
```
1 SRP = [ Tokens in Combined Token Pool / Global SRPs ] FIO
```
Tokens in *Combined Token Pool* is:
* incremented:
  * When users stake tokens
  * When tokens are earmarked as *Staking Rewards*
* decremented:
  * When users unstake tokens
  
Global SRPs is is:
* incremented:
  * When users stake tokens
* decremented:
  * When users unstake tokens
  
Because staking and un-staking increments/decrements tokens in *Combined Token Pool* and *Global SRPs* at the then current ROE, only addition of *Staking Rewards* to *Combined Token Pool* will increase the ROE.

ROE will be initialize at 1 FIO = 1 SRT and remain that until *Combined Token Pool* is equal to or greater than *Combined Token Pool Minimum*.

In addition:
* ROE can only go up, so user is guaranteed at least their principal back.
* The sooner they stake the better the ROE.
* The more fees collected, the higher the ROE.
* Future ROE and therefore annualized return cannot be determined at the time of staking as it is dependent on future fees collected and tokens staked

### Rewards for TPID
When user unstakes FIO Tokens, the TPID attached to the unstake action receives (using same methodology as all TPID rewards: accrues to TPID and is claimed using claim_tpid_rewards) 10% of the difference between tokens being unstaked and FIO Tokens received as a result of SRP to FIO Token conversion. If no TPID is provided, the 10% remains undistributed.

# Rationale
## Other approaches
There were several versions of staking [discussed and considered](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/34078744/FIO+Staking). The SRP approach was modeled after [EOSIO REX Implementation](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.contracts/issues/117). EOSIO requires a transfer of tokens and issues a transferable REX token. FIO’s implementation does not have to require a transfer because:
* We do not have a requirement for the reward point to be transferable.
* We do have ability to lock tokens in account.

## Vote/proxy on unstake
Requiring users to vote/proxy within 30 days on ustake was considered, but abandoned due to potential usability impact.

## Burning/minting of tokens for Staking Rewards
An approach was considered to burn the 25% of tokens paid on any fee and then minting that amount when required to pay out the rewards on unstaking. It was abandoned to stay consistent with how fees are collected and tracked today.

## Changes to locks
As part of this FIP, [it was discovered](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FC/pages/218333199/Lock+period+precision+issue) that existing [FIP-6](fip-0006.md) locking functionality, which uses percentage for each lock period, will not be able to sufficiently support unstaking locking required by this FIP. As a result, and to make locks more robust for future applications, this FIP modifies locking to accept SUFs instead of percentages when specifying period amount. In addition, [FIP-29](fip-0029.md) was created to disable existing locking until this enhancement can be delivered.

# Implementation
## Detailed Design 
The detailed design, project plan, and implementation plan will be published into the [Development Specification](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FD/pages/91127818/FIP-21+FIO+Staking+Development+Spec).

## Token burning
Foundation will burn 25,000,000 FIO Tokens from [FIO Address Giveaways](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#tokens-minted-over-time) using retire action being implemented in [FIP-22](fip-0022.md). Tokens from the following buckets would be burned:

# Backwards Compatibility

# Future considerations
