# Abstract
This FIP proposes to extend FIO Protocol functionality to enable FIO Block Producers to use [regproducer](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-regproducer) to update their producer information.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|eosio|regproducer|/register_producer|Modifies the action to allow the updating of specific fields.|

# Motivation
Currently, [regproducer](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-regproducer) can only be used to create new producer records. If a producer calls `regproducer` to update their information, they get an error: `Already registered as a producer.` FIO Block Producers have requested an enhancement to the protocol to allow the use of `regproducer` to update their information.

# Specification

## Modified actions

### Register Producer
* Register a new block producer
* Update public key, location, url for a registered block producer 

#### Contract: eosio

#### Action: *regproducer*

#### End point: /register_producer 

#### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_address|Yes|FIO Address|Valid FIO Crypto Handle|
|fio_pub_key|Yes|FIO Public Key|The producer's public key that is used for signing.|
|url|Yes|Producer URL|URL of block producer's website.|
|location|Yes|Producer Location|Location ID of where BPs servers are located.|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-fee/get-fee) for correct value.|

#### Example
```

{
  "fio_address": "producer@bob",
  "fio_pub_key": "FIO7tHihSLJVRQ2HsiVGTXAh3RgfXQvVVPpMm8pwQtiTHQHPnY5dH",
  "url": "https://bobp.io/",
  "location": 80,
  "actor": "aftyershcu22",
  "max_fee": 10000000000
}

```

#### Processing
* Validate inputs as necessary
* Only fio_address, url, producer_public_key and location can be updated
* If registering new producer (owner does not exist in the table)
    * Confirm fio_address is registered to owner 
    * The actor is authorized to emplace on behalf of the actor parameter
    * A FIO Handle cannot be used again unless it has a new owner (actor)
    * Emplace new producer record. The "actor"
* If owner already exists in producers table:
  * If fio_address is changed, confirm it is registered to owner and update
  * Update url, producer_public_key and location parameters (should be validated similar to new record)

#### Exception Handling

The following exception handling conditions are altered. 
If the producer is active, assert the url, public_key or location are different and can be updated.

|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ErrorFioNameNotReg |Producer calls regproducer and is already in producer table with is_active=1.|400|"actor"|Value sent in|"Already registered as producer"|

#### Response
```
{
  "status":"OK",
  "fee_collected":"10000000000"
}
```
