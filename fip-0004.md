## Abstract
This FIP implements the following:
* Adds new API end point and contract action to remove selected pub addresses.
* Adds new API end point and contract action to remove all pub addresses.

## Motivation
Presently the FIO API does not provide any way for a user to remove public address mappings for a user:
* It is foreseeable that users will have a need to remove pub address mappings
* When a certain token is no longer supported
* Whenever a user might desire to remove a certain mapping from state for privacy reasons.

## Specification
### Remove FIO address
#### New end point: *remove_pub_address* 
#### New action in fio address contract remaddress
##### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_address|Yes|fio address, see FIO address validation rules.|FIO Address which will have public addresses removed.|
|public_addresses|Yes|JSON Array. See [/add_pub_address for details](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/add-pub-address/add-pub-address-model). Min: 1 |The public address to be removed from the address mapping.|
|max_fee|Yes|max fee SUFs|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by /get_fee for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address of TPID, See FIO Address validation rules|FIO Address of the wallet which generates this transaction. This FIO Address will be paid 10% of the fee. See FIO Protocol#TPIDs for details. Set to empty if not known.|
|actor|Yes|FIO account name|FIO account for the signer, the account owning this payee FIO Address.|
###### Example
```
{
    "fio_address": "purse@alice",
    "public_addresses": [{
                          "chain_code": "BTC",
                          "token_code": "BTC",
                          "public_address": "1PMycacnJaSqwwJqjawXBErnLsZ7RkXUAs"
                         },{
                           "chain_code": "ETH",
                           "token_code": "ETH",
                           "public_address": "0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b"
                         }
                        ]
    "max_fee": 0,
    "tpid": "rewards@wallet",
    "actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
##### Processing
* Verify the fio address format.
* Verify the fio address exists. 
* Verify the number of public addresses specified. Minimum of 1
* Verify the public addresses specified exist in the mappings on the chain
* Verify that all information (chain code, token code and public address match the on chain mapping), error if failure
* if any one of the public addresses does not exist on chain then error.
* Check that fio_address is owned by actor.
* require auth of the actor
* verify that the fee for this does not exceed the max fee specified.
* charge appropriate fee (this will be a bundled fee transaction, fee will be same as reject)
* verify tx does not exceed max transaction size.
* since this reduces state NO RAM BUMP.
* remove all specified public addresses.
* Return status json containing status (ok), and fee charged.

## Fees
A new fee will be created remove_pub_addresses, type 1, 600000000 SUF, this is bundled, bundle counter will be decremented 1 for each call.

## Rationale
Custom end points were put in place to make interaction with FIO Protocol easier for developers by hiding the complexity of EOSIO tools. Enhancing the functionality is done for the same reason. Advanced tools such as *get_table* remains unchanged.

We make the use of this to be similar to add pub address so as to keep the API familiar for developers (min of 1 max of 5)

We will discuss how best to add an option to remove all with the team and add this into this FIP

## Implementation
* Add new API end point for remove pub address
  --modify chain_api_plugin to add new endpoint, modify chain_plugin.cpp and hpp to add new params and code. Add new action (remaddress) to fio.address.cpp and fio.address.abi. dev test api endpoint and push action and resolve all issues (2 days)
