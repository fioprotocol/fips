# Abstract
After this FIP is adopted:
* Unlimited size of _content_ parameter in New Funds Request is allowed. Transaction would still be subject to transaction limit.
* _new_funds_request_ fee is assessed based on size of request.
* Bundled transactions charged by _new_funds_request_ are assessed based on size of request.
* LNBC token code is part of [FIP-15 Chain and token code standard](fip-0015.md).

# Motivation
[Recent assessment](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FC/pages/374243331/Lightning+Network+Support+in+FIO) of how FIO Protocol can support Lightning Network has uncovered that:
* Since Lightning Network [uses Invoices](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) instead of addresses, FIO Request is the best mechanism to support Lightning in FIO Protocol.
* Current [New Funds Request](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-newfundsreq) [content parameter size limitations](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/docs/how-to/encryption#size-limitations-on-encrypted-data) do not support a typical Lightning Invoice string.

This FIP's objective is to increase the size of content parameter in New Funds Request to accommodate Lightning Invoice or any other data that FIO Protocol users would want to include in FIO Request.

# Specification
## Lightning Standard support
LNBC token is added to [FIP-15 Chain and token code standard](fip-0015.md) to enable integrators to distinguish Lightning transaction from the base layer transaction (BTC).

## Modified actions
### New Funds Request
Modifies processing to allow unlimited size of _content_ parameter and changes fee/bundles calculation to be based on request size.
#### Contract: fio.reqobt
#### Action: newfundsreq
#### Request body
No change
#### Processing
* _content_ parameter max size validation is removed.
* The fee is determined based on the following logic:
  * If paying with fee: _new_funds_request_ fee is charged per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.
  * If paying with bundled transactions: Y bundled transactions are charged per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.
  * Account's RAM is bumped by Z per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.

X, Y, Z, and if sizing is based on request or _content_ parameter will be determined during implementation and this FIP will be updated.
#### Response body
No change

# Rationale
## Dynamic fee pricing
Rather than increasing the size of the _content_ parameter to a bigger fixed number, it was determined that the best strategy is to implement a dynamic pricing model where the fee, or bundled transaction cost, is increased dynamically as the size of the _content_ parameter grows.

Similar model is already being used for _msig_propose_ and _auth_update_, although those actions do not allow payment using bundled transactions.

# Implementation
X, Y, Z, and if sizing is based on request or _content_ parameter will be determined during implementation and this FIP will be updated.

Also, during implementation, level of effort to support same logic in record_obt should be evaluated and discussed if this FIP should be amended to include that change as well.

# Backwards Compatibility
Since there is no change to the request or response parameters in _newfundsreq_ action, there should be no impact on existing implementations.

However, if an integrator is currently expecting that the size of the _content_ parameter will not exceed a certain size, their integration may have to be updated. An advisory to all existing integrators should be issued once this FIP is deployed.

Since Lightning Network FIO Requests will use a unique token code (LNBC), wallets which do not support Lightning will not require any changes as they likely already show an error when an unsupported token code is received in a FIO Request.

# Future considerations
For consistency, a similar approach could be adopted for [recordobt](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-recordobt) in the future.
