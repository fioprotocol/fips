## Abstract
This FIP implements the following:
* Adds the ability for FIO Address owners the ability to burn an owned address.
* Adds the ability for FIO Domain owners the ability to set their domain as expired.
* Adds new API end points for FIO Domain deactivation and FIO Address burning.
* Adds new fees for FIO Domain deactivation and FIO Address burning.

## Motivation
Presently the FIO Blockchain only burns and removes old addresses and domains once they reach their expiration date. This feature proposal will allow address owners the ability to burn their addresses at any time and will allow domain owners that are looking to deactivate the domain to have their expiration set to the current time. Setting this expiration allows for the continued use of the domain during a grace period ( currently set to 90 days ). All FIO Addresses linked to that domain will be burned after their expirations but will not be able to be utilized. The domain will follow normal expired domain processes after the grace period. Once burned, a new domain owner may register the domain. If domain owner wishes to activate their domain after deactiviation, owners may call `/renew_fio_domain` and continue normal operation.

## Fees
A new fee will be created for `deactivate_fio_domain`. This fee will not be bundle eligible and should cost ~800000000 SUF.

## Rationale
Adding the functionality to remove these addresses and setting domains to expired at any given time gives the owners flexibility. There are many reason why someone would want to burn their FIO Address/Domain:
   * Business/Personal requirements
   * Cost effectivness 
   * Spam prevention

## Implementation
The following files will be affected during this implementation:
   * fio.address.cpp
   * chain_plugin.cpp/.hpp
   * chain_api_plugin.cpp
   * httpc.hpp ( clio )
   
The fio.address smart contact, Clio, and the chain plugin are all required to be updated. The proposer will update to current fio version with the new clio and chain_plugin updates. They will then propose the msig for the fio.address contact to the active Block Producers. It is suggested that the top 21 Block Producers vote for the fees of the two new endpoints before the execution of the msig.

On execution [RAM of signer will be increased](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/fio-protocol/resource-management#ram-limits) by 512 bytes.
