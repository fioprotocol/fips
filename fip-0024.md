## Abstract
This Fip introduces a standard for private communication between wallets without broadcasting the transaction to the fio blockchain.

## Terminology
* **Sender** - user sending a message.
* **Recipient** - user receiving a message.
* **Message** - information or request the sender submits to the recipient.
* **Wallet** - software following a user's instructions.
* **Location** - address of the inbox used to reach the recipient's wallet. May be an ip address, url, onion address or other form of unique location identifier.
* **Fixed server** - a system that is continuously running and connected to the internet with a fixed domain, ip address or tor address.
* **Public address** - public address in a native blockchain.

## Motivation
Currently, the fio protocol doesn't have a truly private communication system. Standardizing a direct messaging protocol that minimizes the use of the blockchain will increase privacy and reduce per user space consumption on the fio network.

## Specification
A standard will be defined to interchange private encrypted information.

### Methodology
To exchange information with the holder of a fio address, the sender's wallet will fetch an inbox location and the fio public key registered to that fio address using the [/get_pub_address](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-pub-address/get-pub-address) call (or an otherwise defined request call with that purpose). Then it will encrypt a signed message using a shared secret derived with the Diffie Hellman protocol (ECDH with AES-256-CBC) and submit it to the supplied location.

The recipient's wallet will respond using the same method.

### Inbox location
As most wallets aren't regularly available on a managed uninterrupted network, a fixed server (personal, borrowed or rented) might be used as relay for local mobile and desktop wallets, the same way smartphones exchange emails using smtp servers.

### Message construction
All messages will include an encrypted blob and information on how to interpret it.

In order to protect the user's privacy from third parties, all recognizable identification data in the message will be encrypted. The sender is, instead, identified by a token previously assigned by the recipient in a previous message.

### Message actions
To facilitate development, secure message actions will be defined in a similar way to fio api [endpoints](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec) and actions proposed in [fip-0008](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0008.md).


|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|peer_new_com_request|Requests for a communication channel to be established by proving the sender's identity and assigning an identification token to the recipient.|
|peer_new_funds_request|Requests for a payment to be deposited to a specific public address (sends an invoice).|
|peer_new_pub_address_request|Requests the recipient for a public address to deposit funds to.|
|peer_return_message_status|Confirms that a message was received. Informs if message was successfully read by the wallet; returns error code otherwise.|
|peer_accept_request|Informs the recipient that a specific request was accepted and returns the required data.|
|peer_reject_request|Informs the recipient that a specific request will not be executed.|
|peer_cancel_request|Informs the recipient that the sender is no longer interested in the referenced petition.|
|peer_update_data_request|Requests the receiver to change the communication data registered to the sender (e.g.location and id token)|
|peer_close_com_request|Requests recipient to ignore data registered under that communication channel and treat any future contact as new.|
|peer_send_private_text|Sends a private memo.|

#### Opening a communication channel
Before any practical messages can be interchanged, secure communication between the wallets must be established.

##### Encryption
To establish a channel, sender's wallet must write an initiating message containing the sender's fio address and an identification token. The initiating message must be encrypted asymmetrically with an integrated encryption scheme (ECIES with AES-256-CBC) using the recipient's fio public key and sent to recipient's inbox location.

Having decoded the initiating message, the recipient will be able to use the [/get_pub_address](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-pub-address/get-pub-address) call to obtain the senders public key and use it to derive a shared secret for symmetric encryption. This will be used to encrypt all future communications between the two parties.

##### Generating identity token
After decoding the message, a random string will be generated to identify all messages sent by the same peer.

##### Storing sender data
The message contents, the derived shared secret, and the id token will be stored unencrypted on a local database under a new communication channel assigned exclusively for that sender-recipient fio address pair.

##### Responding the message
Depending on the configuration, the wallet might reply with a "message received" status and wait for the user to decide whether to accept or reject the communication request or automatically send a full response.

If the decision to accept the request is taken, the wallet will reply with a confirmation message to communicate the success and send the identification token to be used on the following messages.

### Fetching information
To safely communicate with the owner of a fio address, its necessary to acquire the wallet's inbox location and public key. The latter is registered by default as the public address for the fio token under the user's control, and may be obtained as such.

#### Adding new token
Inbox locations will have to be assigned under new token code standards. Alternatively, a new endpoint could be created for this purpose.

The standard for each type of address will be added to the fip-0015 specification. Address format might also be added to the endpoint error handler.

##### Example:
|chain_code|token_code|multi_level_parameters|name|slip_44_index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|FIB|IPA||Inbox IP address||
|FIB|URL||Inbox Url||
|FIB|OA3||Inbox onion address V3||

```

  "public_addresses": [
    {
      "chain_code": "FIB",
      "token_code": "URL",
      "public_address": "172.102.105.111:3030",
    },

```

### Protocol calls
#### Open new communication channel request
##### Description:
Requests for a communication channel to be established by proving the sender's identity and assigning an identification token to the recipient.

##### Endpoint:
peer_new_com_request

##### Notes:
* As the communication is being established and no identification tokens have been exchanged, the initiating message must be encrypted asymmetrically with an integrated encryption scheme (ECIES with AES-256-CBC) using the receivers fio public key.
* The string "NEW" must be used in place of id. This instructs the recipient to decrypt the content with the correct algorithm.
* If communication is relayed by an external server but the message not successfully decrypted, the sender's identity will not be established and no error codes will be returned to the sender.
* See the "Opening a communication channel" section for more information on how the first message is constructed.

## Notes
### Features
The proposed method offers an alternative solution against communicating exclusively through fio blockchain request.

Advantages:
* High privacy
* Less fees
* Easier management for the user
* Higher scalability for the network
* Decreased per interaction write calls and space consumption in the fio blockchain
* Ability to add interwallet actions without modification to the fio protocol code
* Less limitation on messages length
* May (theoretically) be implemented through any communication protocol

Disadvantages:
* Requirement of a static location address
* Requirement of a fixed server for the inbox (may belong to a third party)

### Privacy level
The method requires a location to be publicly assigned to a fio address; and at least two requests to the fio blockchain to get the inbox location and public key of each new peer. This might leave small traces of information on some private servers (not an issue for most people).

If a user wishes to use the protocol with absolute privacy (outside of sharing his fio address with his peers) he may achieve this by using obfuscated addresses (via vpn or the tor Network) and run a private fio node.

### Inbox server
#### Message processing
Note that even though the messages might be sent to a shared fixed server, the server will (sometimes) act only as an inbox to relay the message to the wallet and will not (necessarily) hold any keys, verify signatures decrypt information or handle message specific exceptions. Those tasks belong to the wallet.

For this reason, getting a "202" (accepted) http status code doesn't necessarily imply the message was successfully received and processed by the recipient.

#### Shared server addresses
For servers being accessed by multiple clients, a unique inbox identifier might be needed so that the server may know which
 user to relay the message to. Such identifiers must be included on the inbox location registered on the blockchain.

## Rationale
### Encryption
As most communications are naturally encrypted, additional encryption on the message content may seem redundant. However, as the end user is not likely to control the relaying server, an extra layer of protection will shield the user's privacy from third parties.

#### Initiating message
Encrypting the sender's fio address with an asymmetric algorithm aids in the protection of the user's privacy by obfuscating the relation between the two parties to any actor observing their communications.

An alternative method for this purpose, would be for both users to manually input each other's fio address (or click an invitation link) before starting communication. This would reduce significantly the complexity of the communication protocol, but would also reduce user friendliness.

#### Encrypting all content
As the message data is stored on the wallet instead of a public database, the content of the message can be decrypted and stored as plain text as to facilitate filtering of information. This means there is no inconvenience in hiding important fields behind a cipher for transfer.

#### Per address pair channel opening
Creating one channel per fio address pair will, in some cases, result in multiple channels per peer, as some users might control more than one fio address/key. Nevertheless, managing multiple keys or fio addresses per channel would make peer management excessively complex. This could open each wallet to strange errors and vulnerabilities which should be avoided.

### Included content
#### Fio addresses
Even though the fio addresses of the sender and the recipient should be implicit and could be deduced by the recipient wallet in most messages, they have been purposely required to simplify wallet implementation, avoid multiple identity conflicts, and protect the user against security exploits (e.g. surreptitious forwarding attacks).

## Future considerations

### Spam prevention
As communication require sender's private key signature and a registered fio address, abused address lists may be used to filter communication from spamming addresses.

### Derived id token
An alternative method to reusing id tokens or sending new ones for every new message would be to specify a standard to use the hash of a seed and a counter. This would generate predictable single use identification tokens that change automatically for each message and only known by the communicating parties.

### additional actions
Other actions may be added in the future to extend the functionality and ease of use of the communication mechanism.
For example:
* [Request for signature](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/53314345/Request+for+Signature)
* Request to return accepted payment forms (token codes)
* Request for amount to be paid (ask for an invoice)
* Send message prove to verify recipient's reachability
* Confirm the arrival of a previous message

### additional data fields
More data fields might be added to allow better communication. These might include fields like:
* Date and time
* Application specific arbitrary data
* Contact information
* Hyperlinks

### Possible upgrades
On future iterations of the protocol, more advanced features might be invoked by adding new actions or modifying existing ones. These might include systems to:
* Automate recurring payments
* Pre-authorize automatic charges
* Generate complexly formatted invoices
* Distribute invoices amongst groups
* Transmit complex wallet instructions through messages
* Collect microtransactions on a time based system
* Redirect messages to other wallets
* Continuous conversation (chat)
* File and multimedia content transfer

### Interactive requests
Funds requests may be modified to allow the users to specify data through the wallet instead of using an external interface. A user could, for example, choose a payment method interactively inside his wallet, instead of receiving a public address on a specific token.

### Server business model
Just like the are companies that charge small (or no) fees for a simple email account, there could be a business model around fio peer messages. And, even though, server centralization could, potentially, lead to privacy and censorship concerns, any usable service would inheritably expand the protocol functionality and augment it's privacy (even if a particular provider is ill intentioned), and no user would be obligated to acquire any specific service.

A standard could also be specified, as part of the protocol, for the wallet to automatically setup and manage server accounts.

### Fio blockchain integration
The fio software could, theoretically, be upgraded to support the secure message system natively, and have private interactions between the users without the need for external servers.

For this purpose, 2 new endpoints would need to be added to the protocol.

1. A request to record an encrypted message in the blockchain.
2. A request to fetch all messages containing a specific id token.

Of course as blockchain space is limited, messages would have to be optimized in size, and fees would probably have to be calculated in function of space and time.

For this modification to work, the user recipient would have to manually add the sender's fio address to his peer list before communicating for the first time or click an invitation link.

To implement the use of a private initiator message avoiding the requirement for invitation links or other kinds of external communication (which is not user friendly) Several different solutions could be implemented; for example:

* Prepaid deposit inboxes
* Preassigned limited storage inboxes
* Side stealth fio key pairs
* Join transactions
* Anonymous transaction fee payment methods
* Specially designed smart contracts
* Trusted relaying third parties
* Ring signatures
* Message starting groups

Needless to say, most of the options could complicate the implementation extensively or create further problems to solve (like invitation spam).
