# Abstract
This FIP will let anyone set an auto-renew option on a domain and if they do, the domain will automatically be renewed before expiration date using funds of the account which set the auto-renew.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|setdomrenew|/set_fio_domian_autorenew|Sets FIO Domain to auto-renew.|

# Motivation
FIO Domains need to be renewed every year or they will expire and be burned. The blockchain does not allow renewal notifications that many users are used to in Web2 world. As a result domains are sometimes forgotten to be renewed and are burned. Auto-renew action will let users, who have FIO Tokens in account, set auto-renewal flag and have the domain renew automatically.

# Specification
## Process
1. User sets a domain to be renewed using _adddomrenew_
   - Any user can set auto-renew on any domain
   - More than one account can have auto-renew set on the same domain
2. User calls _renewdomains_
   - Any user can make this call. It carries no fee if renewal is executed and returns exception if there are no renewals to be executed. It works similarily to _burnexpired_.
   - Domains which are set to expire in less than 7 days and have auto-renew set are identified.
   - If more than one account is set to renew the same domain, the first account which set the renewal flag and has sufficient funds is identified.
   - Domain is renewed or exception is returned.
3. User removes renewal flag using _remdomrenew_
   - Only user who set a renewal flag on specific domain can remove it.
   - Flag is removed and auto-renewal will not be conducted by this account.
  
## New actions
### Add Auto-renew to a FIO Domain
Sets a domain to be auto-renewed.
#### Contract: fio.address

#### RAM increase: To be determined during implementation
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_domain|Yes|Valid FIO Domain|FIO Domain to auto-renew.|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://dev.fio.net/reference/get_fee) for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address of the entity which generates this transaction. TPID rewards will be paid to this address. Set to empty if not known. Auto-renew transactions will carry this TPID.|

```
#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
* * RAM of actor calling action is increased.
* add_fio_domian_autorenew is charged to actor calling action.
* Check for maximum FIO transaction size is applied.
* FIO Domain set to be renewed by calling account.
