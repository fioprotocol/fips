# Abstract
This FIP extenda the FIO Protocol functionality to enable FIO Domains to be mapped to [DNS Resource Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Resource_records) which would make them usable within existing [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) applications, such as mapping a FIO Domain to a website.

# Motivation
Neither FIO Crypto Handles (FCHs) nor FIO Domains currently support the resolution of Internet Protocol addresses akin to [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). Some community members have expressed interest in adding such capability to the FIO Protocol as it would add more utility to the FIO Domains and the FIO Protocol overall. Since FIO Chain is a full decentralized blockchain, hosting DNS mappings on it would allow them to be immutable and not subject to centralized control.

# Specification
## DNS Record
FIO Domain owner can attach multiple DNS Record(s) to their FIO Domain. The DNS Records follow [RFC-1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1) format:
* NAME - FIO domain name to which this resource record pertains.
* TYPE - Two octets containing one of the RR TYPE codes.
* CLASS - Two octets containing one of the RR CLASS codes.
* TTL - A 32 bit signed integer that specifies the time interval that the resource record may be cached before the source of the information should again be consulted
* RDATA - A variable length string of octets that describes the resource

The DNS Record is stored in FIO Chain state. FIO Chain getters can retrieve a specific record `type` or all records. The getters will not perform recursive DNS look-ups. This function will be relegated to an off-chain resolver which ingest the raw DNS records and queries external DNS servers if required.

## Top-level Domain (TLD)
To ensure compatibility with traditional DNS, a _.fio_ TLD is required for all FIO Domains. The TLD is only required and used in connection with the DNS Record and is not impacting the existing FIO Domain and FIO Handle functionality, which continues to be used without TLD.

 _.fio_ TLD is not currently supported by ICANN and therefore there would not be any collisions with traditional DNS. Foundation for Interwallet Operability could fund the _.fio_ TLD application with ICANN in the future once TLD applications resume. [Alternative DNS Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root), such as [Handshake](https://handshake.org/) may also be considered.

## Sub-domains
Sub-domains are allowed in connection with the DNS Record and is not impacting the existing FIO Domain and FIO Handle functionality, which continues to be used without sub-domains.

## New actions
### Add/Modify/Delete DNS Record
Will attach map FIO Domain to DNS Record.

Example request
```
{
	"name": "subdomain.alice.fio",
	"type": "A",
	"class": "IN",
	"ttl": 300,
	"rdata": "104.26.11.44",
	"max_fee": 1000000000,
	"tpid": "rewards@wallet",
	"actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```

## New getters
### Get DNS Record
Will fetch DNS record associated with supplied name and record type.

Example request
```
{
	"name": "alice",
	"type": "A"
}
```

# Rationale
Adding DNS mapping capabilities to the FCH would fail to achieve this goal and could potentially be confusing to users due to the FCH format which contains the '@' symbol, e.g. purse@alice. Therefore, this FIP proposes adding mapping capability to FIO Domains instead.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
None anticipated.

# Future considerations
New TLDs may be added in the future.
