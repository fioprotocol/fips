# Abstract
This FIP adds ability supply FIO Public Key, different from FIO Public Key for receiving tokens, to use for encryption of New Funds Request/Record OBT content blob.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|updcryptkey|/update_encrypt_key|Updates the FIO Public Key to use for encryption of New Funds Request/Record OBT content blob.|

## New getters
|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|/get_encrypt_key|Returns the FIO Public Key to use for encryption of New Funds Request/Record OBT content blob.|

# Motivation
Certain content on FIO Chain, e.g. FIO Request details, [are encrypted using Diffie-Hellman encryption scheme](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/docs/how-to/encryption). This scheme requires private key of one party and a public key of another. Today the key used for encryption is the same key which is used for sending and receiving tokens and is obtained using _get_pub_address_.

An improvement has been suggested to have a separate key for receiving tokens and for encryption. This would allow for a different security scheme to be applied to each key. In fact, the account owner may not even have access to a private key designated as the receiving key for tokens, e.g. it’s in cold storage, while they do need to have access to the private key in order to decrypt some FIO Chain data.

It is important to note, that the encryption key is only used by the client and has no use on-chain. Here's how is encryption key used:

#### Sender is encrypting data intended for receiver

|Step|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Fetch receiver's FIO Public Key to use for encryption.|_get_pub_address_ for sender's _fio_address_, _chain_code: FIO_, _token_code: FIO_|_get_encrypt_key_ for sender's _fio_address_|
|Encrypt the data|Client process|No change|
|Send on-chain transaction|_newfundsreq_ or _recordobt_|No change|

#### Receiver is decrypting the data from Sender

|Step|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Read FIO Public Key to use for decryption from the specific record|_get_received_fio_requests_, _get_sent_fio_requests, _get_pending_fio_requests_, _get_obt_data_, _get_cancelled_fio_requests_|No change|
|Decrypt the data|Client process|No change|

# Rationale
Storing the encryption key as a new _token_code_ for _chain_code:FIO_ using _add_pub_address_ was considered. However, it would have been harder to support backwards compatibility in that an existing getter _get_pub_address_ would have to be modified for a specific chain_code and token_code.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
It is recommended that _/get_encrypt_key_ is rolled out ahead of _updcryptkey_ and an advisory is issued to wallets and exchanges instructing them to start using the new getter. The current encryption key will be returned by _/get_encrypt_key_ even if unique key is not specified using _updcryptkey_.

After 90 days _updcryptkey_ should be enabled to allow for a new key to be added. This delay should decrese the chances that a wallet obtains invalid encryption key because it used _/get_pub_address_ instead of _/get_encrypt_key_
