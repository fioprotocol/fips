> **Please note:** This smart contract is being deployed as requested by [pNetwork](https://p.network/). The authors of this FIP do not make any guarantees as to the functionality or security of the [pNetwork](https://p.network/) platform.

# Abstract
The purpose of this FIP is to develop functionality which will enable FIO Chain to participate in the [pNetwork](https://p.network/) cross-chain ecosystem, which in turn will make it possible for the FIO Token to be wrapped to any chain supported by pNetwork.

Proposed new actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.pnetwork|peginrequest||Public action to peg in FIO Tokens to pNetwork.|
|fio.pnetwork|pegin||Private action to peg FIO Token to pNetwork. Only callable from *pegInRequest* action and used by pNetwork to recognize the peg in.|

# Motivation
It is believed that making the FIO Token accessible on as many chains as possible will aid in the goal of promoting the FIO Protocol to all crypto users, starting with their native chain community they are familiar with.

# Specification
## High-level overview
### pNetwork
#### Mission
"The pNetwork ecosystem is aimed to solve blockchain's walled-garden limitation. A set of security-oriented technologies designed to boost the blockchain ecosystem."
#### Vision
"The pNetwork is a decentralized system open for anyone to contribute. It complements blockchain, while empowering it to reach its full potential."
#### Network
"pTokens aims to be a decentralized open-source system facilitating cross-chain movement of assets."
#### Terminology
* peg in - moving FIO Token from FIO Chain to pNetwork.
* peg out - moving FIO Token from pNetwork back to FIO Chain.

### pNetwork FIO Chain implementation
#### Vault Account
pNetwork will establish a FIO Chain account which will be used to hold pegged in FIO Tokens. The account will be controlled by pNetowrk and will be hardcoded into the fio.pnetwork contract.
### Peg in workflow
* pNetwork user wants to peg in native FIO Tokens to PFIO on another chain using pNetwork dApp.
* dApp obtains the fee using [/get_fee](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#post-/get_fee) for pegin_request and show the user
* pNetwork dApp calls *peginrequest* action on fio.pnetwork system contract passing:
  * Quantity of FIO.
  * Destination address of intended recipient on another chain.
* *peginrequest* action:
  * Transfer funds from the user to the Vault Account.
  * Charges a FIO Chain fee to the user or decrements their bundled transactions.
  * Bumps RAM on user account.
  * Calls *pegin* action.
* *pegin* will only be callable by other system contracts, i.e. by *peginrequest* and is only intended for pNetwork systems to properly recognize the peg in without heavy customization.

### Peg out workflow
* pNetwork user wants to peg out PFIO on another chain into native FIO Token using pNetwork dApp.
* pNetwork dApp calls [existing *trnsfiopubky*](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-trnsfiopubky) action on fio.token contract passing:
  * Destination FIO Public Key of intended recipient on FIO Chain.
  * Quantity of FIO.
* *trnsfiopubky* action:
  * Transfer funds from Vault Account to intended recipient on FIO Chain.
  * Charge a FIO Chain fee to Vault Account.
  * Bumps RAM on Vault Account.

## New actions
### Peg in Request
Public action to peg in FIO Tokens to pNetwork.
#### New contract: fio.pnetwork
#### New action: *peginrequest*
#### New end point: NONE
#### New fee: pegin_request, bundle-eligible (1 bundled transaction) fee amount will be determined during development and updated here
#### RAM increase: will be determined during development and updated here
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|amount|Yes|Int|SUFs to pegin.|
|memo|Yes|String, min 1, max 128 characters|Information required by pNetwork to properly route the pegin.|
|fio_address|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address to use for bundled transactions. If non using bundles leave blank.|
|max_fee|Yes|Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by /get_fee for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address of TPID, See FIO Address validation rules.|FIO Address of the wallet which generates this transaction. This FIO Address will be paid 10% of the fee. See FIO Protocol#TPIDs for details. Set to empty if not known.|
|actor|Yes|FIO account name|FIO account for the signer, the account owning this payee FIO Address.|
###### Example
```
{
  "amount": 1000000000,
  "memo"" "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "fio_address": "purse@alice",
  "max_fee": 0,
  "tpid": "rewards@wallet",
  "actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
#### Processing
* Validate request per Exception handling.
* Transfer funds from actor to the Vault Account.
* If valid and unexpired FIO Address with sufficient bundled transactions deduct bundled transactions by 1, else charge a pegin_request fee to the actor.
* Bump RAM on actor account.
* Call *pegin* action and pass:
  * sender: actor
  * tokenContract: fio.token
  * quantity: SUFs converted to asset quantity, e.g. 1111000000 = 1.111 FIO
  * memo: memo

# Rationale
This approach adds pNetworks support to FIO Chain with the least amount of customization to existing pNetwork infrastructure.

# Implementation
See https://gist.github.com/bertani/7eb66d9f911ad9562eafa56618c9d7ff for prototype contract.

# Backwards Compatibility
This is a new contract and actions and no changes are made to existing contracts or actions.

# Future considerations
None.
