# Abstract
This FIP removes the restriction that transfer_locked_tokens can only transfer tokens to a FIO Public Key which has not yet been established as an account.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|trnsloctoks|/transfer_locked_tokens|Allow transferring of locked tokens to existing accounts.|
|multiple|Token transfer or payment of fee|multiple|Clear lockedtoken table entries for matured locks.|

# Motivation
When [FIP-6: Transfer locked tokens](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) functionality was built, a decision was made to only allow locked token transfers to brand new accounts. This was done to simplify the implementation and satisfied the use case requirements at that time.

Since then, [FIP-21: FIO Staking](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0021.md) has rearchitected the locked token functionality and made it much easier to support transfers of locked tokens to existing accounts.

A new use case (recurring compensation with locked tokens) has also elevated the requirement to support this feature. 

# Specification
## Modified actions
### Transfer locked tokens
Allow transferring of locked tokens to existing accounts.
#### Contract: fio.token
#### Action: *trnsloctoks*
#### End point: /transfer_locked_tokens 
#### Request
Unchanged
#### Processing
Modify the logic so that:
* transfer_locked_tokens with _can_vote:0_ can only transfer tokens to a FIO Public Key which has not yet been established as an account, or an account which has a lock entry with _can_vote:0_
Remove the following exceptions handling:.
* transfer_locked_tokens with _can_vote:1_ can only transfer tokens to a FIO Public Key which has not yet been established as an account, an account with no lock entries, or an account which has a lock entry with _can_vote:1_

Remove the following exceptions handling:
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Account already exist|Account hashed down from Public Key alreday exists.|400|"payee_public_key"|Value sent in|"Locked tokens can only be transferred to new account."|

Add the following exception handling:
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unable can_vote:0 to existing account|can_vote is set to 0 and target account already exists on chain|400|"can_vote"|Value sent in, e.g. "0"|"Locked tokens with restricted voting can only be transferred to a new account."|
|Unable can_vote:1 to account with lock entry of can_vote:0|can_vote is set to 1 and target account has a lock entry with can_vote:0|400|"can_vote"|Value sent in, e.g. "1"|"This account has voting restriction on locked tokens, sending locked tokens without voting restriction is not allowed."|
#### Response
Unchanged

### Token transfer or payment of fee
Clear lockedtoken table entries for matured locks.
#### Contract: multiple
#### Action: multiple
#### End point: multiple
#### Request
Unchanged
#### Processing
Modify the logic so that:
* Lock table entry for account is cleared if all locks have matured, meaning 100% of all locked tokens are now unlocked.
#### Response
Unchanged

# Rationale
## Multiple locked token transfers and _can_vote_ parameter
_can_vote_ allows the sender of locked tokens to specify if the locked tokens can be voted before they unlock. The functionality was part of the original [FIP-6](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0006.md) which was designed to established the locks on account creation and assumed the locks would not be modified in the future. As a result, there is only one lock entry per account and one of its parameters is _can_vote_, which applies to all tokens locked in that account.

[FIP-21](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0021.md) introduced the ability to add new periods to existing lock entry but failed to properly consider the impact of the _can_vote_ parameter on tokens locked as a result of unstake. This causes the following behavior to exist on Mainnet:
* Alice uses _trnsloctoks_ to send Bob 100 FIO tokens and specifies _can_vote:0_
* Bob acquires 1000 FIO tokens and stakes them
* Bob unstakes 1000 FIO tokens which causes a new period be inserted into the lock table. However, because _can_vote_ applies to all tokens locked and was previously set to 0, Bob's unstaked tokens are not votable until the unstake lock expires (7 days). This is not what was intended, but is deemed acceptable.

To avoid further exacerbating the problem, transferring of locked tokens with voting restriction remains restricted to new accounts only.
