## Abstract
This proposal addresses enhancements to the FIO Protocol command line utility known as CLIO.

* Create additional subcommands to support FIO actions
* Cleanup and repair of existing subcommands
* Handling of additional FIO error codes

## Motivation
The command line utility has not been maintained and deserves some customization for FIO before handing off to our community of block producers

## Specification

### Proposed new subcommands:
|Option|Subcommand|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Request|new|Create a new FIO Request|
|Request|reject|Reject a FIO Request|
|Request|cancel|Cancel a FIO Request|
|Data|record|Record an on-blockchain transaction|
|Domain|burn_expired|Process expired domains|
|Domain|register|Register a new FIO Domain|
|Domain|renew|Renew a FIO Domain|
|Domain|set_public|Set a FIO Domain to Public or Private|
|Domain|transfer|Transfer a FIO Domain to a new owner|
|Address|register|Register a FIO Address|
|Address|add_pub|Add a Public Blockchain Address to a FIO Address|
|Address|remove_pub|Remove Public Blockchain Addresses from a FIO Address|
|Address|renew|Renew a FIO Address|
|Address|remove_all_pub|Remove all Public Blockchain Addresses from a FIO Address|
|Address|transfer|Transfer a FIO Address to a new owner|
|Fee|set_amount|Set endpoint fees (for producers)|
|Fee|set_multiplier|Set the fee multiplier|
|System|claimrewards|Claim Block Producer Rewards|
|System|tpidclaim|Pay our rewards to TPIDs|
|Convert|fiokey_to_account||
|Transfer||Transfer FIO coins to a FIO public key|

### Removed Subcommands
|Option|Subcommand|
|---|---|
|system|buyram|
|system|sellram|
|currency|retire|
|currency|transfer|

### Added functionality
|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Rename keosd|keosd folder, binaries and symbols renamed fio-wallet to avoid confict with keosd used on systems with a shared EOS installation|
|Default max_fee|max_fee is set to 800000000001LL so user does not have to define manually. Any required fee set by the producers under this value will process|
|Custom Push Endpoints|Certain transactions are pushed to a FIO chain api push endpoint depending on the action. Any undefined go to /v1/chain/push_transaction|
### Proposed functionality
|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|auto max_fee|v1/chain/get_fee is queried with the corresponding endpoint for the packed action and max_fee variable is set to this result|
|custom endpoint option|true/false bool that will allow all transactions to be pushed to custom endpoints or all to /v1/chain/push_transaction|

## Rationale
The current implementation of clio provides very basic functionality that allows signing and pushing of FIO transactions requiring nested json syntax which may be too difficult for some users.

## Implementation
Involves adding new objects, methods to clio main.cpp and httpc.hpp for some new strings

## Future considerations
None
