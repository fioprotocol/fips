# Abstract
This FIP proposes to reallocate 38,505,959.4 FIO Tokens from 13 permanently locked Initial Integrating Wallet accounts to FIO Handles Giveaways bucket.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|fipxlviii|None|Reallocate FIO Tokens per FIP-48.|

# Motivation
In FIO Chain genesis, 648,746,346 FIO Tokens were [allocated](https://fio.net/token/distribution) to different accounts for different purposes. Specifically, as it relates to this FIP:
* FIO Handles Giveaways bucket: 125,000,000 FIO Tokens were allcoated to the FIO Foundation with restrictions to be spent on FIO Chain fees to offer free FIO Handles to initial users. This was reduced in [FIO-21](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0021.md) to 100,000,000 and reduced further in [FIP-23](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0023.md) to 90,000,000.
* Initial Integrating Wallet Reward bucket: 113,940,385 FIO Tokens were sent to wallets belonging to application developers (wallets and exchanges) who committed to launching FIO Protocol integration within 210 days of Mainnet launch. If the integration was not launched, as attested on-chain by the FIO Foundation, the tokens were to remain permanently locked. Thirteen integrators failed to launch the integration in time and 38,505,959 FIO Tokens remain permanently locked (see Initial Integrating Wallets in Affected Accounts below).

As of 2024-06-21, FIO Handles Giveaways bucket is estimated to hold 15M FIO Tokens which, at current rate of free FIO Handle registrations and at current FIO Handle registration fee, will run out sometime in October 2024. The FIO Foundation believes that the FIO Handles Giveaways bucket remains instrumental in promoting the adoption of the FIO Protocol and should be replenished.

This FIP proposes to reallocate 38,505,959.4 FIO Tokens from 13 permanently locked Initial Integrating Wallet accounts to FIO Handles Giveaways bucket. As a result, 38,505,959.4 FIO Tokens will, over time, transition from locked token supply to liquid token supply. Because FIO Handle fees are locked when spent for a period of one year, it is estimated that it will take two years to transition the entire 38,505,959.4 FIO Tokens to liquid supply. As all tokens in FIO Handles Giveaways bucket, the reallocated tokens would remain restricted and could only be spent on FIO Chain fees. The total supply hard cap is unchanged by this FIP and remains at 1B.

|status|String|OK if successful|
##### Example
```
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

# Rationale
Other options to accomplish the stated goal has been considered, such as block producer invoking a native `transfer` action, but it was determined that building a FIP-specific action is a more transparent way to enact the change.

# Implementation
## Overview
1. New action name fipxlviii
2. The new action can only be called by eosio account (MSIG from BPs)
3. The target account will be hardcoded into the action.
4. The new action will attempt to process all of the affected accounts in one call. There are 13 accounts, these accounts will be processed serially without any use of looping or data structures. All account names and amounts will be hardcoded into the contract action. For each account the following logic will be used.

## Action logic
1. Check if the account is in the locked tokens table.
    * If not report “NO WORK” exception.
    * If present then continue processing.
2. Verify the balance of the account is >= the desired amount.
    * If not then reset transfer amount to the remaining balance in the account and increment the number of accounts with unexpected transfer amounts.
3. Transfer the amount from Step 2 for this account into the specified target account.
4. Remove the lockedtokens entry for this account from the lockedtokens table.
5. Increment total amount transferred by the amount in Step 2.
6. Modify the lockedtokens record for the target account.
    * Set the total_grant_amount to be the total transferred.
    * Set the remaining_lock_amount to be the total transferred.
7. Report status: ok, total_transferred: total amount transferred, status_code: 0 - all went as per spec, non zero - the number of accounts with unexpected transfer amounts (the tx log can then be used to find them).
