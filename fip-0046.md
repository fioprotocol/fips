# Abstract
This FIP proposes an update to FIO chain_plugin to increase the timeout placed on get_table_rows queries.

## Modified actions
None

## Modified getters
|End point|Description|
|---|---|
|get_table_rows|Max time default increase and setting moved to config file.|

# Motivation
Currently get_table_rows has a 100 ms max timeout which results in a limited number of results being returned for some secondary indexes. FIO paging on secondary indexes relies on first getting the full results, and then paging through the results as defined by limit and offset. If the full results are not returned in the initial query, then it is not possible to access some data from some FIO getters. 

The current timeout limits the number of returned results to 1000-2000 items.

# Specification

## Proposed update to the max timeout setting
The WALKTIME constant in the chain_plugin.hpp file will be split into two constants. One constant for the access of primary indices will be set to 100milliseconds. One constant for the access of secondary indices will be set to 1 second. This change will permit tens of thousands of rows to be present within a secondary index and the existing FIO paging using offset and limit will work accurately.

## Proposed update to the chain config.ini settings
None. We will deliver a solution that provides an increased time limit for secondary indices throughout the protocol in the FIO chain plugin. In EOSIO the config.ini information can be made available to plugins by modifying the FIO code tochange the way in which the http plugin invokes read only elements of the chain_api. This modification of EOSIO design was seen as adding risk and complexity to upgrades. 

## Modified end points

### get_table_rows
There will be no changes to the parameters for get_table_rows or other FIO getters.

#### Processing
* The update will result in greater processing time for get_table_rows queries thus resulting in more returned data in those cases where the number of records is greater than 1,000 - 2,000 records.

#### Exception handling
No change

#### Response
No change

# Rationale
This fix will solve the current issue where some FIO getter calls do not return all the needed records.

# Backwards Compatibility
None. Existing getter request and response bodies are unchanged.

# Future considerations
None
