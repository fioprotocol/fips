# Abstract
After this FIP is adopted:
* Unlimited size of _content_ parameter in Record OBT Data is allowed. Transaction would still be subject to transaction limit.
* _record_obt_data_ fee is assessed based on size of request.
* Bundled transactions charged by _record_obt_data_ are assessed based on size of request.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.reqobt|recordobt|/record_obt_data|Modifies processing to allow unlimited size of _content_ parameter and changes fee/bundles calculation to be based on request size.|

# Motivation
The size on _content_ parameter in New Funds Request was changed to unlimited in [FIP-32](fip-0032.md). It is therefore logical to allow unlimited size of content field in Record OBT Data.

# Specification
## Modified actions
### Record OBT Data
Modifies processing to allow unlimited size of _content_ parameter and changes fee/bundles calculation to be based on request size.
#### Contract: fio.reqobt
#### Action: recordobt
#### Request body
No change
#### Processing
* _content_ parameter max size validation is removed.
* The fee is determined based on the following logic:
  * If paying with fee: _record_obt_data_ fee is charged per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.
  * If paying with bundled transactions: Y bundled transactions are charged per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.
  * Account's RAM is bumped by Z per each X bytes of request or _content_ parameter size.

X, Y, Z, and if sizing is based on request or _content_ parameter will be determined during implementation and this FIP will be updated.
#### Response body
No change

# Rationale
Same approach was implemented in [FIP-32](fip-0032.md).

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
Since there is no change to the request or response parameters in _recordobt_ action, there should be no impact on existing implementations.

However, if an integrator is currently expecting that the size of the _content_ parameter will not exceed a certain size, their integration may have to be updated. An advisory to all existing integrators should be issued once this FIP is deployed.

# Future considerations
None
