Partial release. Transfer FIO Domain released in [fio v2.0.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/releases/tag/v2.0.0), [fio.contracts v2.1.0](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

Transfer FIO Address has not been released.

## Abstract
This FIP implements the following:
* Adds ability to transfer FIO Domain to new owner using new action
* Adds ability to transfer FIO Address to new owner using new action
* Adds new API end points for FIO Domain transfer, FIO Address transfer
* Adds new fees for FIO Domain transfer and FIO Address transfer
* Modifies search logic for get_obt_data, get_pending_fio_requests, get_sent_fio_requests, get_cancelled_fio_requests

## Motivation
Both FIO Domain and FIO Address are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are owned by a FIO Public Key. Ability to transfer ownership is a must, yet there is currently no support for it in FIO Protocol. It was always assumed that this will be one of the first improvements to the FIO Protocol.

## Specification 
### Transfer FIO Domain
#### New action: *xferdomain*
##### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_domain|Yes|FIO Domain|Valid and unexpired FIO Domain|
|new_owner_fio_public_key|Yes|FIO public key|FIO Public Key of the new owner. If account for that key does not exist, it will be created as part of this call.|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by /get_fee for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address of the entity which generates this transaction. TPID rewards will be paid to this address. Set to empty if not known.|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
###### Example
```
{
	"fio_domain": "alice",
	"new_owner_fio_public_key": "FIO8PRe4WRZJj5mkem6qVGKyvNFgPsNnjNN6kPhh6EaCpzCVin5Jj"
	"max_fee": 30000000000,
	"tpid": "rewards@wallet",
	"actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
##### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling
* Fee is collected
* Account is derived from hashing new_owner_fio_public_key
* If new owner account does not exist, it gets created
* Owner of domain is changed from current account to account hashed from public key
	* Action explicitly not taken:
		* Domain expiration date is not updated
		* is_public flag is not updated

### Modification to existing queries
#### get_obt_data
get_obt_data is modified to only return OBT records which include the provided FIO Public Key. It currently returns OBT records which include FIO Addresses owned by the provided key at the time of query, which would cause new owner to see old requests, even though they could not decrypt the contents.
#### get_pending_fio_requests
get_pending_fio_requests is modified to only FIO Requests which include the provided FIO Public Key. It currently returns FIO Requests which include FIO Addresses owned by the provided key at the time of query, even though they could not decrypt the contents.
#### get_sent_fio_requests
get_sent_fio_requests is modified to only FIO Requests which include the provided FIO Public Key. It currently returns FIO Requests which include FIO Addresses owned by the provided key at the time of query, even though they could not decrypt the contents.
#### get_cancelled_fio_requests
get_cancelled_fio_requests is modified to only FIO Requests which include the provided FIO Public Key. It currently returns FIO Requests which include FIO Addresses owned by the provided key at the time of query, even though they could not decrypt the contents.


## Rationale
### Purging of data
Other Blockchain Public Addresses (OBPA) mappings should be purged on FIO Address transfer to avoid the risk of new owner not realizing there are mappings already attached to their address that are not theirs.

Aside from OBPA mappings, FIO Address is associated to FIO Requests and FIO Data. Initial approach was to purge this data, but that is not feasible since this data has a counter-party and they should be able to retrieve the data post transfer. You can also argue that the previous owner should be able to access their data, even though they have transferred ownership of the FIO Address.

Since the contents of FIO Request and FIO Data is encrypted using private/public keys at the time the request is sent, the new owner will not be able to decrypt it.

Wallets, at their discretion, may choose to check if FIO Address of displayed FIO Request has changed since original request and show a notification to the user viewing an old request.

### Fees
Both FIO Domain and FIO Address transfers should each have a new fee type. The fee should be high enough to cover possible new account creation.

## Implementation
The following files will be affected during this implementation:
   * fio.address.cpp
   * chain_plugin.cpp/.hpp
   * chain_api_plugin.cpp
   * httpc.hpp ( clio )
   
The fio.address smart contact, Clio, and the chain plugin are all required to be updated. The proposer will update to current fio version with the new clio and chain_plugin updates. They will then propose the msig for the fio.address contact to the active Block Producers. It is suggested that the top 21 Block Producers vote for the fees of the two new endpoints before the execution of the msig.

On execution [RAM of signer will be increased](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/fio-protocol/resource-management#ram-limits) by 512 bytes.

## Backwards Compatibility
### New actions
*xferdomain* and *xferaddress* are new actions and therefore do not impact existing users
### New API end points
*/transfer_fio_domain* and */transfer_fio_address* are new end points and therefore do not impact existing users
### New fees
*setfeevote* takes an array of fees and is not required for that action to have all possible fees. Adding new fees will therefore not break that action.
### Modification to existing queries
*get_obt_data*, *get_pending_fio_requests*, and *get_sent_fio_requests* will continue to only return relevant data, so modifications to the SDKs and wallet integrations are not required.

## Future considerations
An escrow functionality for domain transfer could be beneficial. A new domain transfer action could be created which would allow a domain owner to specify amount and optionally FIO Address of potential buyer. When executed the domain would be put in escrow until buyer makes a payment, using unique action, equal to specified amount. The domain would then be transferred to buyer and funds to seller.
