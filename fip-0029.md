# Abstract

## Execute actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|eosio|remaction||Remove trnsloctoks from list of whitelisted actions.|

# Motivation
During a [discussion regarding FIP-21 Staking](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FC/pages/218333199/Lock+period+precision+issue#2021-06-01-Discussion) a decision was made to modify FIP-6 locking structure to reflect lock period amounts in SUFs not percentages. In order to avoid complex migration, this FIP temporarily disables transfer of locked tokens functionality, until it is redeployed with [FIP-21](fip-0021.md).

# Specification
## Execute actions
This FIP will temporarily disable the Transfer of locked tokens by removing it from list of whitelisted actions using eos.io -> remaction.

# Rationale
This has been deemed the best approach to temporarily disable an action.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
This FIP will disable trnsloctoks. However, this action is not currently being used.

# Future considerations
Transfer of locked tokens will be re-enabled as part of [FIP-21](fip-0021.md).
