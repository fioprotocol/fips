# Abstract
Functionality proposed in this FIP is intended to make wrapping of FIO Domains easier.

Wrapping cannot be accomplished entirely inside the FIO Protocol and therefore will not be possible with this FIP alone. This FIP only defines the functionality required in FIO Protocol. For detailed overview of the greater initiative see [Enable FIO Token and Domain NFT wrapping](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/7012357/Enable+FIO+Token+and+Domain+NFT+wrapping).

Proposed new actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.oracle|wrapdomain|wrap_fio_domain|Transfers FIO Domain to designated FIO account on the way to another chain.|
|fio.oracle|unwrapdomain||Transfers FIO Domain to designated FIO account back from another chain.|

Modified actions:
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|xferdomain|transfer_fio_domain|Transfer of FIO Domain is now allowed even if the domain has expired.|

# Motivation
It is believed that the ability to wrap FIO Tokens and Domain NFTs will be beneficial to the FIO Community. It will open up new use cases for FIO Tokens and Domains such as:
* Enable FIO Domains to be traded on NFT trading sites such as Open Sea as ERC-721s.
* Enable FIO tokens to be used in a rapidly growing Defi ecosystem such as Uniswap which rewards token holders for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges.

# Specification
## Overview
This FIP proposes a new fio.oracle system contract (controlled by eosio account or block producers). It will allow pre-defined oracles to transfer FIO Domains owned by the smart contract if all oracles agree to do so.

### Use cases
### Wrapping FIO Domain
* User A wants to wrap FIO Domain to P public address on C chain.
* User A fetches amount of Oracle fee using */get_oracle_fees*.
* User A executes *wrapdomain* action and passes in:
  * *fio_domain* (D) to wrap
  * *public_address* (P) on chain C where domain should be delivered
  * *chain_code* C
  * *max_oracle_fee* - maximum amount of FIO user A is willing to pay the Oracles
* FIO Domain is transferred to wrapping smart contract account
* Oracle fee is transferred from user A and distributed evenly to all registered Oracles.
* Oracles monitor every block looking for *wrapdomain* action (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected Oracles trigger minting of FIO Domain NFT on another chain (not covered by this FIP).

### Un-wrapping of FIO Domain
* User A wants to unwrap FIO Domain to F FIO Address on the FIO Chain.
* User A executes action on another chain (not covered by this FIP):
* Oracles monitor every block on another chain (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected each Oracle executes *unwrapdomain* action and passes in:
  * *fio_address* (F) where to transfer domain
  * *fio_domain* (D) to transfer
* Once the last Oracle executes *unwrapdomain* action, FIO Domain is transferred to P.

### Unwrap FIO Domain
Transfers FIO Domain from fio.oracle to designated FIO account.
#### Contract: fio.oracle
#### New action: *unwrapdomain*
#### Fee: none
#### RAM increase: To be determined during implementation
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_domain|Yes|FIO Domain|Valid and unexpired FIO Domain.|

## Modified actions
### Transfer FIO Domain
Transfer of FIO Domain is now allowed even if the domain has expired.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### New action: *xferdomain*
#### Exception handling
Remove the check for expired domain and 400:FIO Domain expired assertion.

# Rationale
Even though wrapping could be accomplished without any new functionality being added to the FIO Protocol, it would be hard. Specifically:
* [/transfer_fio_domain](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0001.md#transfer-fio-domain) does not support memo to pass intended destination public address on another chain. This would require the information to be exchanged off-chain.
* [/transfer_tokens_pub_key](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/transfer-tokens-pub-key/transfer-tokens-pub-key-model) does not support memo either. [/transfer_tokens_fio_add](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0011.md#transfer-fio-tokens-using-fio-address) or [/record_obt_data](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/record-obt-data/record-obt-data-model) would have to be used, but even then the information would have to be provided as part of free-form memo field.

get_wrapped_fio_domains and get_wrapped_fio_tokens calls were considered, but deemed unnecessary, as [selected FIO Token and Domain NFT wrapping solution](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/7012357/Enable+FIO+Token+and+Domain+NFT+wrapping) will rely on monitoring every block.

An approach was considered to make the contract generic, so that anyone could create a wrapping system, but configuring that generic contract and building their own oracles and smart contracts on another chain. This approach was deemed too complex to consider at this stage, but could be revisited in the future. In the meantime anyone can submit their own FIP to deploy a new wrapping contract to the FIO Chain.

Transfer of FIO Domains was allowed after domain is expired to ensure that the oracles do not have to handle an assertion of attempting to unwrap a domain which has expired, but has not yet been burned. It is not deemed a critical action to disable after expiration.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
New actions with no impact on existing functionality.

# Future considerations
* Consider generic wrapping contract.
