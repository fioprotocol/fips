# Abstract
This FIP adds ability to create a new FIO Chain Account with custom permission in one action.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|eosio|newfioacc|/new_fio_chain_account|Creates a new FIO Chain Account.|

# Motivation
Because accounts on FIO Chain are [created automatically](https://dev.fio.net/docs/accounts-and-permissions) when a new FIO Public Key is used, the _newaccount_ action is not supported. However, every time a new account is created it has the FIO Public Key, which hashes down to the account name, set as the active and owner permission. This may break some user flows which would want to create a new account with custom permissions in one action.

It's therefore deemed beneficial to enable new account creation with ability to specify custom permission in one action.

# Specification
## New actions
### New FIO Chain Account
Creates a new FIO Chain account.
#### Contract: eosio
#### New action: *newfioacc*
#### New end point: /new_fio_chain_account
#### New fee: new_fio_chain_account, not bundle-eligible, fee amount will be 2 fio
#### RAM increase: 0
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_public_key|Yes|String|The supplied FIO Public Key will be used for: 1) Account name will be a hash of the key; 2) The key will be set as _owner_ and _active_ permissions if those parameters are left empty.|
|owner|Yes|JSON|JSON of authorizations, same as in _auth_ parameter of _updateauth_ action. Must contain the following parameters: ```"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [],  "accounts": []```. ```waits``` array is not supported and must be empty, ```keys``` and ```accounts``` arrays may be populated with desired permissions or left empty, in which case the supplied public key is set as owner permission.|
|active|Yes|JSON|JSON of authorizations, same as in _auth_ parameter of _updateauth_ action. Must contain the following parameters: ```"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [],  "accounts": []```. ```waits``` array is not supported and must be empty, ```keys``` and ```accounts``` arrays may be populated with desired permissions or left empty, in which case the supplied public key is set as active permission.|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://dev.fio.net/reference/get_fee) for correct value.|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address of the entity which generates this transaction. TPID rewards will be paid to this address. Set to empty if not known.|
##### Example
```
{
	"fio_public_key": "FIO5rebL4c6KTJcyYb8aaGpw13Tpm8Xu9RaK1TtcvicCaUr4GiRwF",
	"owner": {
		"threshold": 2,
		"keys": [],
		"waits": [],
		"accounts": [
			{
				"permission": {
					"actor": "1jynjfoswglg",
					"permission": "active"
				},
				"weight": 1
			},
			{
				"permission": {
					"actor": "qhdo4r2pltdr",
					"permission": "active"
				},
				"weight": 1
			},
			{
				"permission": {
					"actor": "tsksksw1jxrb",
					"permission": "active"
				},
				"weight": 1
			}
		]
	},
	"active": {
              "threshold": 1, 
              "keys": [],
              "waits": [],  
              "accounts": []"
             },
	"max_fee": 1000000000,
	"actor": "aftyershcu22",
	"tpid": "rewards@wallet"
}
```
#### Processing
* Both `owner` and `active` fields are required
* When adding multiple `accounts` or `keys` as permissions, **the strings must be in alphabetical order**
  * See [greymass discussion on key sorting](https://github.com/greymass/eosio-core/issues/8) for more information.
* Request is validated per Exception handling
* New account is created in the same manner as is created when using _trnsfiopubky_
* RAM of actor calling action is increased.
* new_fio_chain_account is charged to actor calling action.
* Check for maximum FIO transaction size is applied.

# Rationale
Enabling of _newaccount_ action was considered. It is a system action now, but could have been made public. However, that approach was deemed more complex as it would require updates to other smart contracts which are calling this action now.
