# Abstract
This FIP adds ability to create a new FIO Chain Account with custom permission in one action.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.system|newfioacc|/new_fio_chain_account|Creates a new FIO Chain Account.|

# Motivation
Because accounts on FIO Chain are [created automatically](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/docs/fio-protocol/accounts-permissions) when a new FIO Public Key is used, the _newaccount_ action is not supported. However, every time a new account is created it has the FIO Public Key, which hashes down to the account name, set as the active and owner permission. This may break some user flows which would want to create a new account with custom permissions in one action.

It's therefore deemed beneficial to enable new account creation with ability to specify custom permission in one action.

# Specification
## New actions
### New FIO Chain Account
Creates a new FIO Chain account.
#### Contract: fio.system
#### New action: *newfioacc*
#### New end point: /new_fio_chain_account

#### RAM increase: 0
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|

# Rationale
Enabling of _newaccount_ action was considered. It is a system action now, but could have been made public. However, that approach was deemed more complex as it would require updates to other smart contracts which are calling this action now.
