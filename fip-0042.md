# Abstract
This FIP introduces a new action which registers both the FIO Domain and FIO Address in a single action. It also allows the user to specify, in the same action, if the domain should be public or private.

## New actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.address|regdomadd|/register_fio_domain_address|Registers FIO Domain and FIO Address.|

# Motivation
Currently it is not possible to register a FIO Domain and FIO Address in a single transaction. One has to register a FIO Domain first and then the owner has to register a FIO Address on it. This creates difficulties when the registration is not performed by the owner, e.g. the registration site operated by the Foundation. The registration site collects funds (e.g. BTC) and then registers the domain to owners FIO Public Key. However, it cannot register the FIO Address in the same process, because if the domain is private only the owner can register and they have to pay with FIO Tokens from their own account.

This FIP enables the creation of a FIO Domain and FIO Address in a single transaction.

# Specification
## New actions
### Register FIO Domain and Address
Registers FIO Domain and FIO Address.
#### Contract: fio.address
#### New action: *regdomadd*
#### New end point: /register_fio_domain_address
#### New fee: register_fio_domain_address, not bundle-eligible, fee amount will be determined during development and updated here
#### RAM increase: To be determined during implementation
#### Request body
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_address_domain|Yes|Valid FIO Address|FIO Address on a new domain. Both the domain and FIO Address will be registered.|
|is_public|Yes|0 or 1|0 - the domain will be private; 1 - the new domain will be public.|
|owner_fio_public_key|Yes|String|FIO Public Key of the owner of the FIO Domain and FIO Address being registered.|
|max_fee|Yes|Positive Int|Maximum amount of SUFs the user is willing to pay for fee. Should be preceded by [/get_fee](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/get-fee/get-fee) for correct value.|
|tpid|Yes|FIO Address|FIO Address of the entity which generates this transaction. TPID rewards will be paid to this address. Set to empty if not known.|
|actor|Yes|12 character string|Valid actor of signer|
##### Example
```
{
  "fio_address_domain": "purse@alice",
  "is_public": 0,
  "owner_fio_public_key": "FIO8PRe4WRZJj5mkem6qVGKyvNFgPsNnjNN6kPhh6EaCpzCVin5Jj",
  "max_fee": 30000000000,
  "tpid": "rewards@wallet",
  "actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```
#### Processing
* Request is validated per Exception handling.
* New account is created with _owner_fio_public_key_ if it does not yet exist.
* RAM of actor calling action is increased.
* register_fio_domain_address is charged to actor calling action.
* Check for maximum FIO transaction size is applied.
* FIO Domain is registered with _is_public_ as supplied with owner_fio_public_key as owner.
* FIO Address is registered on new domain with owner_fio_public_key as owner.

#### Response body
|Parameter|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|status|String|OK if successful|

##### Example
```
{
  "status": "OK",

}
```

# Rationale
An alternative approach was considered to modify _regaddress_ action to automatically register a FIO Domain if supplied FIO Address is on a non-existent domain. However, it was considered confusing to the user and would forced them to figure out what fee would be charged upon successful registration.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
No changes to existing actions. However, any statistics system which looks for _regdomain_ to figure out new domain registrations would have to be updated to also look at _regdomadd_.

# Future considerations
None
