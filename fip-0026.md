# Abstract
What we are planning to create is a marketplace where users can buy and sell FIO Domains.  Users will interact with the frontend website to view and place domains up for sale.  The frontend will interact with the FIO Escrow Smart Contract to facilitate transactions between users who buy and sell domains.

### Proposed new actions:

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|listdomain|User puts domain up for sale|
|cxlistdomain|Seller of domain decides not to sell and cancels their listing|
|rnlistdomain|Listings expire in 90 days. A seller can choose to renew their listing with one action|
|buydomain|User buys a domain that is up for sale|
|setmrkplcfg|The `mrkplconfig` table holds configs for a given marketplace. This action writes to that table.|
|rmmrkplcfg|Removes a marketplace from the `mrkplconfig` table|
|setmkpcomfee|Sets the marketplace commission fee in the `mrkplconfig` table|
|setmkplstfee|Sets the marketplace listing fee in the `mrkplconfig` table|
|setmkplstdur|Sets the marketplace listing time in the `mrkplconfig` table|
|setmkpwrntm|Sets the marketplace warn time in the `mrkplconfig` table|
|sethldacct|Sets holder account public key to the `holderacct` table|


# Terminology
* **Listing** - a domain that is up for sale
* **Marketplace** - the frontend website
* **Seller** - the seller of a domain
* **Buyer** - the buyer of a domain
* **Listing Fee** - fee paid to the marketplace from the seller to the marketplace. Flat fee in FIO.
* **Commission Fee** - fee paid to the marketplace when a domain is sold. This is a percentage of the sale price.
* **Holder Account** - This is the account that is designated to hold ownership of domains while they are listed for sale.

# Motivation
There does not currently exist a platform for buying, selling, and trading FIO Domains.  As the popularity of FIO grows, the likelihood of a desired domain being available decreases.  It is also common for individuals to purchase names of popular name brands in order to later sell the domain to the company who owns the brand (name squatting).  Without a marketplace for domains to be sold, these transactions become difficult.  By providing ease of use solutions to name and address transactions, a marketplace also increases the revenue flow of block producers by increasing the amount of fees generated by each transaction.

# Specification

## Core Concept
Users will interact with the frontend website to view and place domains up for sale.  The frontend will interact with the FIO Escrow Smart Contract to facilitate transactions between users who buy and sell domains.  The diagram below displays how the user, the website, the smart contract and the account that owns the smart contract all work together.

![Image of UML Diagram](https://github.com/iwill610/FDM_UMLsd/blob/main/FIO%20Domain%20Marketplace.png)

This diagram reads left to right and top to bottom.  There are three different scenarios outlined and they are distinguished by the color of the arrows.  The first scenario, in red, starts will the user using the website to place a domain up for sale for a specified price.  This user is denoted as "seller."  To initiate this scenario, the seller will pay a listing fee to list their domain for sale on the marketplace.  The website then communicates that the smart contract needs to use the "listdomain" action, which will transfer ownership of the domain to a “holder account” and place that domain for sale on the website. 

The second scenario, in blue, starts will the seller canceling their listing on the website.  The website then communicates with the smart contract in order to transfer ownership of the domain from the holder account back to the seller. 

The last scenario, in green, starts with a different user buying a listing on the website.  This second user is denoted as "buyer."  The website then communicates with the smart contract in order to transfer ownership of the address to the buyer and transfer the funds used to buy the domain to the seller.  The marketplace will take a commission for facilitating this transaction.

### 90-Day Listing Period
Domains can only be listed for a 90-day period 
* At the end of the 90 days, domain can be renewed for another 90-day period
* If domain will expire within the 90-day period:
  * It cannot be listed
  * If trying to renew – listing will be canceled and the domain will be sent back to the seller – seller will have to renew the domain and re-list the domain

### Check Expired Listings

#### New action: *chkexplistng*
This action needs to be run periodically to check the listings to see if they are expired. If they are and the seller has a `notif_address` set, a FIO request for a small amount of FIO will be sent with a message notifying them their listing is about to expire. If there is no `notif_address` and the domain expires, the cancel listing action will be called which will remove the listing from the `domainsale` table and transfer the domain back to the seller.

Anyone can call this action. It only needs to be called once a day, though 

#### Processing
- Iterate through all domains listed on `domainsale` table. 
- If `expiration` is less than `warn_dur` days away and there is a `notif_address` on the listing
    - If `warned_expire` is not true
    - A notification will be sent to the `notif_address` via a FIO request about the pending expiration
    - Flip the `warned_expire` bool to true
- if no `notif_address` provided nothing will happen
- if now() is greater than `expiration` then the *cxlistdomain* action is called which will transfer the domain back to the seller and delete the listing.

#### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|

|Invalid marketplace|Supplied `marketplace` is not found in marketplace config table `mrkplconfig`|400| |"Marketplace not found"|

### Changes to existing actions

- Added the following code to `fio.token::transfer` so that, from the fio.escrow contract, it can transfer tokens from two accounts.
```c++
if (from != SYSTEMACCOUNT && from != TREASURYACCOUNT && from != EscrowContract) {
    if(!has_auth(EscrowContract)){
        check(to == TREASURYACCOUNT, "transfer not allowed");
    }
}
eosio_assert((has_auth(SYSTEMACCOUNT) || has_auth(TREASURYACCOUNT) || has_auth(EscrowContract)),
             "missing required authority of treasury or eosio");
```

Note: I added a `&& from != EscrowContract` and then wrapped the `check()` to see if the caller `!has_auth(EscrowContract)`.

### Added action to existing contract

- `fio.address::xferescrow` has been added to facilitate the transferring of domains between two accounts without the standard fees. This action is only available when called from `fio.escrow`.

#### New action: *fio.address::xferescrow*

This is an action added to the `fio.address` contract specifically for the fio.escrow contract. Only the `EscrowContract` can call this action.

This action facilitates transferring the domain for sale to the holder account and back to the seller in the case of a cancel. In the case of a sale it transfers to the buyer.

#### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_domain|Yes|FIO domain name|valid, registered, unexpired domain|
|public_key|Yes|FIO public key|Valid FIO Domain that is already listed|
|actor|Yes|FIO Domain|Valid FIO Domain that is already listed|

# Rationale
* We may not need api end-points for our actions so none are included in this document, as of right now
* Fees are still being discussed, so those are not included either.  We would love your input on our fee structure in the second discussion link below.
* Any section that is blank will be filled out in the future as we get further along in the process

# Backwards Compatibility
TBD

# Future considerations
* Functionality for addresses
* Being able to renew a domain upon purchase
* Messaging system
* Expiring domain page to see all domains that are about to expire
* For the frontend to facilitate the registering of usernames to domains
* Being able to send an offer to the seller and they can either accept or decline
* “Willing to sell” designation
* Being able to send and receive FIO
