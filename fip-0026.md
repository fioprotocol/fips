# Abstract
What we are planning to create is a marketplace where users can buy and sell FIO Domains.  Users will interact with the frontend website to view and place domains up for sale.  The frontend will interact with the FIO Escrow Smart Contract to facilitate transactions between users who buy and sell domains.

### Proposed new actions and end points

|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.escrow|listdomain|list_domain|User puts domain up for sale|
|fio.escrow|cxlistdomain|cancel_list_domain|Seller of domain decides not to sell and cancels their listing|
|fio.escrow|buydomain|buy_domain|User buys a domain that is up for sale|
|fio.escrow|setmrkplcfg|set_marketplace_config|The `mrkplconfig` table holds configs for a given marketplace. This action writes to that table.|
|fio.escrow|cxburned| none |This is an admin action that is only called from fio.address::burnexpired to cancel the listing of a domain if it is burned and still listed for sale (not already sold or cancelled)|
|fio.address|xferescrow| none |Transfers domain to `fio.escrow`. Called from fio.escrow only|

|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|get_escrow_listings|Returns all listings based on status with optional actor parameter for further filtering

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio.token|transfer|none|Added code to fio.token::transfer so that, from the fio.escrow contract, it can transfer tokens from two accounts.|
|fio.address|burnexpired|burn_expired|If a domain is expired and still listed, when it is going to be burned it needs to also be removed as a listing for sale.|
|fio.treasury|bprewdupdate| ? | added `EscrowContract` to authorization list|
|fio.treasury|bppoolupdate| ? | added `EscrowContract` to authorization list|
|fio.treasury|fdtnrwdupdat| ? | added `EscrowContract` to authorization list|

# Terminology
* **Listing** - a domain that is up for sale
* **FIO Domain Marketplace** - the frontend website
* **Seller** - the seller of a domain
* **Buyer** - the buyer of a domain
* **Listing Fee** - fee paid to the marketplace from the seller to the marketplace. Flat fee in FIO.
* **Commission Fee** - fee paid to the marketplace when a domain is sold. This is a percentage of the sale price.
* **Escrow Account (fio.escrow)** - the account that owns the smart contract.
* **E-Break** - Term used within the contract for a setting that will disable all actions in the event of a major exploit or bug found to mitigate damages.

# Motivation
There does not currently exist a platform for buying, selling, and trading FIO Domains.  As the popularity of FIO grows, the likelihood of a desired domain being available decreases.  It is also common for individuals to purchase names of popular name brands in order to later sell the domain to the company who owns the brand (name squatting).  Without a marketplace for domains to be sold, these transactions become difficult.  By providing ease of use solutions to name and address transactions, a marketplace also increases the revenue flow of block producers by increasing the amount of fees generated by each transaction.

# Specification

## Core Concept
Users will interact with the frontend website to view and place domains up for sale.  The frontend will interact with the FIO Escrow Smart Contract to facilitate transactions between users who buy and sell domains.  The diagram below displays how the user, the website, the smart contract and the account that owns the smart contract all work together.

![Image of UML Diagram](https://github.com/iwill610/FDM_UMLsd/blob/main/FIO%20Domain%20Marketplace.png)

This diagram reads left to right and top to bottom.  There are three different scenarios outlined and they are distinguished by the color of the arrows.  The first scenario, in red, starts will the user using the website to place a domain up for sale for a specified price.  This user is denoted as "seller."  To initiate this scenario, the seller will pay a listing fee to list their domain for sale on the marketplace.  The website then communicates that the smart contract needs to use the "listdomain" action, which will transfer ownership of the domain to an “escrow_account” and place that domain for sale on the website.  The escrow account is the account that owns the escrow smart contract and, acts as an intermediary that will hold the domain while listed.

The second scenario, in blue, starts will the seller canceling their listing on the website.  The website then communicates with the smart contract in order to transfer ownership of the domain from the escrow account back to the seller.

The last scenario, in green, starts with a different user buying a listing on the website.  This second user is denoted as "buyer."  The website then communicates with the smart contract in order to transfer ownership of the address to the buyer and transfer the funds used to buy the domain to the seller.  The marketplace will take a commission for facilitating this transaction.

## New Tables

### Listing table

#### domainsale
Holds all the domains currently available for sale with related information like the owner and amount of FIO the user wants.

We are saving the commission fee per domain listing because the commission fee can be changed but for existing listings it should not change because they agreed to list with a certain commission fee. 

|Column|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|id|uint64|Primary key|
|owner|uint64|actor of owners account|
|ownerhash|uint128|hashed value of `owner`
|domain|string|name of domain for sale|
|domainhash|uint128|hashed value of `domain`|
|sale_price|int64|sale price in SUF| 
|commission_fee|int64|commission fee applied to sale price|
|date_listed|uint64|date at time of listing|
|status|uint8|status = 1: on sale, status = 2: Sold, status = 3; Cancelled|
|date_updated|uint64|date last updated status, this will be when the listing was sold or cancelled|

##### Indexes
- Primary Key
- bydomain
- byowner

### Marketplace Config Table

#### mrkplconfig
Holds information related to the marketplace.

|Column|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|id|uint64|Primary key|
|owner|uint64|actor of owners account|
|ownerhash|uint128|hashed value of `owner`|
|commission_fee|uint64|Commission fee is a percentage taken out of the sale price when a domain is sold|
|listing_fee|uint64|Listing fee is taken up front for creating a listing|
|e_break|uint64|This is a setting that will disable all actions in the event of a major exploit or bug found to mitigate damages|

#### Indexes
- primary key

### List Domain for Sale
This action will post the domain up for sale on the marketplace for a specified price. 
A listing fee is collected from the domain owner for this action that goes to the marketplace.
The domain is transferred to the `fio.escrow` account for the duration of the listing. This will prevent the ability to change the domain_public setting but it WILL allow new addresses to be registered on that domain if it is already set to public. 

#### Contract: fio.escrow
#### New fee: list_domain, not bundle eligible
#### New Endpoint: list_domain
#### Ram Increase: To be determined during implementation
#### New action: *listdomain*

### Buy Domain Listing
This action facilitates the purchase of a domain listed for sale. The buyer will pay the full listed price + tx fee. A commission calculated by multiplying the `commission_fee` by the sale price is subtracted and sent to the marketplace owner account. The remaining FIO will be sent to the seller and the domain will be transferred to the buyer.

Example:

- Commission fee is set to 5% 
- Domain listed for 500 FIO
- Buyer pays 500 FIO + tx fee
- Commission calculated by 0.05 * 500 = 25
- 25 FIO is sent to marketplace owner account in marketplace config table
- 475 FIO is sent to seller
- Domain is transferred from `fio.escrow` to buyer.

This sets the marketplace configurations. 

When calling this action for the very first time, to set the owner of the marketplace with the `actor` parameter, it will need to be an msig by eosio.prods.

Once the marketplace actors name is in the table, this same action can be called by the marketplace to set the parameters.

When this action is called as an msig by eosio.prods it will not be charged a fee, but if the marketplace owner calls it, there will be a fee.

### Transfer for Escrow
#### Contract: fio.address
#### New Endpoint: n/a
#### Ram Increase: n/a
#### New action: *xferescrow*
This is an action added to the `fio.address` contract specifically for the fio.escrow contract. Only the `EscrowContract` can call this action.

This action facilitates transferring the domain for sale to `fio.escrow` and back to the seller in the case of a cancel. In the case of a sale it transfers to the buyer.

#### Request
|Parameter|Required|Format|Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|fio_domain|Yes|FIO domain name|valid, registered, unexpired domain|

|isEscrow|Yes|bool|This is a flag that is used to determine if the domain is transferred to fio.escrow or a normal account|
|actor|Yes|FIO Domain|Valid FIO Domain that is already listed|

##### Example

#### Processing
- Request is validated per exception handling
- Find domain
- if isEscrow is true
  - Set domain's owner to `fio.escrow`
- if isEscrow is not true
  - Validate public key
  - get account actor name from public key  
  - set domains owner to name obtained from public key  

#### Exception handling
|Error condition|Trigger|Type|fields:name|fields:value|Error message|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Insufficient Funds|`buyer` doesn't have enough funds|400| | |"Not enough FIO"|

#### Response
none, inline action

##### Example
none

## Modified Actions
### Contract: fio.token
#### Modified Action: transfer

- Added the following code to `fio.token::transfer` so that, from the fio.escrow contract, it can transfer tokens from two accounts.
```c++
if (from != SYSTEMACCOUNT && from != TREASURYACCOUNT && from != EscrowContract) {
    if(!has_auth(EscrowContract)){
        check(to == TREASURYACCOUNT, "transfer not allowed");
    }
}
eosio_assert((has_auth(SYSTEMACCOUNT) || has_auth(TREASURYACCOUNT) || has_auth(EscrowContract)),
             "missing required authority of treasury or eosio");
```

Note: I added a `&& from != EscrowContract` and then wrapped the `check()` to see if the caller `!has_auth(EscrowContract)`.

### Contract: fio.address
#### Modified Action: burnexpired
This action needs to be updated because there is no expiration to a domain being listed. If a domain is expired and still listed, when it is going to be burned it needs to also be removed as a listing for sale.

##### Added Processing
- Look up domain that is being burned in the `domainsales` table
- If found, remove the entry from `domainsales`

```c++
    if (nameiter == nameexpidx.end()) {

# Rationale
## Domain Transfers
An approach was considered to keep the domain ownership with the seller until the buyer makes a purchase and transfer then. However, we feel that having the ownership of the domain transferred to `fio.escrow` account is necessary because it makes sure that when a buyer comes along that it is 100% available for sale. If the ownership doesn't transfer then the seller can still use the domain until it sells, and then, if a buyer comes along it might suddenly, without notice, disappear from their account.

* Domains set to public are still able to have addresses registered on them 
* We may not need api end-points for our actions so none are included in this document, as of right now
* Domains cannot be changed from public to private or private to public while listed for sale. 
* Any section that is blank will be filled out in the future as we get further along in the process

# Backwards Compatibility
TBD

# Future considerations
* Functionality for addresses
* Being able to renew a domain upon purchase
* Messaging system
* Expiring domain page to see all domains that are about to expire
* For the frontend to facilitate the registering of usernames to domains
* Being able to send an offer to the seller and they can either accept or decline
* “Willing to sell” designation
* Being able to send and receive FIO
