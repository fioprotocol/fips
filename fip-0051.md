# Abstract
This FIP proposes that all FIO domains - existing and future - become permanent, one-time purchases. This means eliminating the requirement for annual renewals and treating domains as true, lifetime-owned assets. The change aligns with the original intent behind permanent FIO handles and enhances user safety, retention, and growth potential.

# Motivation
FIO Domain registrations have been declining. Only 160 domains were registered in the first half of 2025 (excluding protocol-reserved names), and nearly 50% of domains were dropped in the prior year. The trend poses long-term risks to protocol health, user confidence, and treasury sustainability.

Some of the leading reasons users avoid FIO domains include fear of commitment, risk of loss, and lack of perceived ownership. Making domains permanent directly addresses these concerns and positions the protocol for stronger growth.

# Specification
A detailed technical specification will be defined later. Some options include:

Option 1.
A domain's expiration_date field will be set to a far-future placeholder (e.g., year 3000) to maintain backward compatibility with current data structures.

Option 2.
The FIO domain renewal logic will be disabled at protocol level. As was the case with the FIO handle renewal logic previously.
Smart contracts and core logic enforcing expiration or renewals will be deprecated or bypassed.

Option 3.
Decrease renewal fee close to 0.

A public recommendation will be issued to block producers to set a higher one-time domain registration fee ($50–$99 equivalent), once renewals are removed.

# Rationale
Boosts protocol revenue through higher upfront fees and surge in new registrations.

Removes key adoption barrier: fear of future renewals or loss.

Aligns with Web3 values - digital sovereignty and asset ownership.

Prevents loss of identity, funds, and long-term user trust.

Establishes consistency between FIO handles (already permanent) and domains.

This proposal isn't just a technical adjustment - it's a survival move.

FIO is bleeding users, domains, treasury, and attention.

Making domains permanent unlocks a virtuous cycle:
→ No renewals
→ More domains registered
→ More users talk
→ Social proof grows
→ More people explore
→ Even more domains registered
→ Cycle repeats

And with scale, it triggers:
Secondary market activity
Real protocol usage
Bundles buying
More organic integrations

# Implementation
A detailed implementation will be defined later.

# Backwards Compatibility
No action is needed from users with existing domains - their ownership will become permanent automatically.

# Future considerations
None.

We're not patching a leak. We're opening a floodgate.
